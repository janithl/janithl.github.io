  </div>
  <div class="article_text">
    <p><em>All alone, I have cried</em></p>
<p><em>Silent tears full of pride</em></p>
<p><em>In a world made of steel</em></p>
<p><em>Made of stone</em></p>
<p>Saturdays are spent at uni, and whenever I'm at uni I think of a 
<a href="https://janithl.github.io/2016/07/shes-wot-m8.html">particular person</a> who 
has nothing whatsoever to even do with uni. At one critical 3 hour paper last
semester, I spent maybe  one and a half hours desperately stuck in an alternate
reality in which we were more than just casual acquaintances.</p>
<p>Uni takes a heavy toll on my brain as well. Just today, within a couple of
minutes of each other, I had to  grapple with Hopfield Nets, Boltzmann Machines
(and energy functions and my old friend - Bayes' theorem), Convolutional Neural
Networks and their various stages of convolution and max pooling, and - in a 
totally unrelated class - flow networks, max-flow min-cut, to graph colouring 
and its many fascinating applications (all the way from scheduling to Sudoku). 
The only prior exposure I had to any of this was knowing that 4 colours are 
enough to colour any map, because I'm a <em>cartonerd</em>.</p>
<p>Anyway, geekery isn't the only reason I <em>enjoy</em> Saturdays. I get to speak to 3 
peers (who are older and wiser, so not really peers) who give me a fresh 
perspective on a lot of things. This week's installment was on dealing with 
bosses and criticism, and how you need to put your head down and accept things 
as they are and not pick fights. I listened, and pondered, but I don't really 
agree - being the socialist and troublemaker that I am. I think bosses need to 
be smarter at this whole game (and more diplomatic) than their charges, and 
maybe get rid of the whole boss/employee thing altogether and see each other 
as partners (like <em>that'll</em> ever happen in our deeply hierarchical society).</p>
<p>Finally, an observation my aforementioned peers made a few weeks ago, and I can 
anecdotally confirm because a lot of my batch-mates who graduated with me ended 
up so, is that a significant segment of female Sri Lankan graduates never work
in that field - or work at all. Even in a highly lucrative area like Software
Engineering. They end up married, and apparently that piece of paper is a 
prerequisite. IDK. So the next time someone asks you why there are so few 
female programmers...</p>
