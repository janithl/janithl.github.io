> The main thing that I learned about conspiracy theory is that conspiracy 
theorists actually believe in a conspiracy because that is more comforting. The 
truth of the world is that it is chaotic. The truth is, that it is not the 
Jewish banking conspiracy or the grey aliens or the 12 foot reptiloids from 
another dimension that are in control. The truth is more frightening, nobody is 
in control. The world is rudderless.
