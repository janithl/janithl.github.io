Subtitle: Doughs it matter?

Watching the [Adam Ragusea New York-style pizza dough recipe][1] inspired me to make
pizza at home, something that I never thought I was capable of. Now, about 3 batches
of pizza later, I think I’ve got most of the big details sorted out. Credit also to
[Andrew Rea for his pan pizza recipe][2] which really helped me with kneading and
shaping techniques.

The prep time is about 3 hours, and I don’t do overnight refrigerator rises (I plan
to, one day, when I’m more patient and can remember to mix the dough the night before
I want the pizza)

### Flour

I use the regular wheat flour, 150g per pizza. I usually make 3–4 pizzas so it’s
usually 450g or 600g. I don’t have a scale, so I use a measuring cup, sue me!

### Water, sugar and yeast

I first take 100ml of water, mix it with half a packet of dry yeast (about 7.5g),
and 2 tablespoons of sugar. Mix well and let it activate for at least 30 minutes
(but longer is better). This will foam up and overtop your container so make sure
you put it on a large enough jar or something.

### Hydration

I’m currently going for 60% hydration. This results in a very sticky dough but I
really like the taste and crunchy fluffiness of the final product.

60% hydration means you add 60% of your flour weight in water. For example if you
have 100g of flour, you add 60g (or 60ml–isn’t SI lovely!) of water. For 600g of
flour, this means adding 360ml of water.

But, **remember that you already added 100ml to the yeast mixture**. So do make
sure to take that into account. You can just top up the yeast mixture with 260ml
of water and add the whole shebang to the flour in a large mixing bowl. Add a
tablespoon of salt and two tablespoons of olive oil (I usually substitute with
_pol thel_ because I am not made out of money).

Mix, mix, mix. You can check [Babish for ways to knead without breaking your back][3].
I used to knead with my hands, but now I just use the mixer attachment in my
immersion blender and small bursts to get the thing kneaded.

Let it rest for 2 hours with a wet cloth on top of the bowl. This step is called
the **bulk ferment**.

### Shaping

After letting your dough rise, break it into 3 or 4 parts. I really eyeball this and
don’t really care about accuracy at this point.

Now, the tricky part of actual shaping. The dough is sticky af and will stick to
anything, and I am currently experimenting with oil paper sheets cut into circles,
[like what Adam Ragusea does sometimes][4].

You drop the dough balls into a bowl of flour, and dust your fingers with flour as
well. Drop the balls onto the oil paper and taking care not to deflate the edge (cornice)
use your fingers to push down and flatten the middle. Doing this and expanding the
pizza to your required size is the least fun part of the whole process for me, and I
have not perfected it at all. After you’re done making a fool of yourself, let it rest
and rise for another 1 hour.

### Sauce

Now is a good time to get started on the sauce. I just chop up one onion (or two), and
smash a clove or two of garlic. I mix in about 2 tomatoes per pizza, so for 4 you’d need
8 tomatoes. It’s a good idea to drop the tomatoes in a hot water bath and peel off the
skins if that’s your thing. People also remove the seeds. I do neither of these things
because I am lazy and I don’t want to throw stuff away. Drop everything into a pan (onions
and garlic first) with oil, add water and tomato sauce as desired, and mix well over
medium heat. Once it looks good season with salt and pepper, and then put everything in a
jar and use an immersion blender to mix it all in.

### Cheese

Don’t get pre-shredded motz. Shred your own motz. American YouTubers swear by adjectives
(“low moisture”, “full fat”), but we don’t really have much variety here right? Get whatever
mozzarella you can and just shred it into a bowl.

### Other toppings

I’ve tried olives, sausages, and bacon. They all work well.

### Baking

Pre-heat your oven to 200°C. Apply the sauce first, then the cheese, then drop any other
toppings. Brush your crust with some oil if you want things to look fancy. Slide your oil
paper’d pizza onto a baking pan to bake[^1]. Your cook time will depend on your oven and
other factors I guess, but for me it’s usually between 15–20 minutes. I know it’s done when
the toppings are getting burnt and the crust starts looking brown (if the crust is still
white I’d advice keeping it in for a bit more). The oil paper should come right off now that
the pizza is baked.

Keep experimenting, and I’m sure you’ll find better ways of doing things. For example if
you want a more burnt bottom you can try a small trick I do and use a _roti pan_ on the
stove to burn the bottom (this can happen before you put it in the oven).
