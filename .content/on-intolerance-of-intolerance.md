Title: On Intolerance (of Intolerance)

I’m sure everyone at this point has read about the [_paradox of tolerance_][1]. It’s
a pretty common sense argument and there are many historial examples that are often
held up, one of the most popular being the rise of the Nazi party in the liberal
democracy of the Weimar Republic.

A problem that I've see cropping up recently (first in online communities, but soon
evolving to have offline consequences) is with the _definition of intolerance_—and
the actions the self-proclaimed ‘defenders’ of tolerance take to guard it.

One example from a few years back was the _Sinha-le_ stickers, and the _Colombo liberal_
reaction to it. Without even considering the origins of the sticker campaign, or
motivations of those who chose to brand their vehicles with said sticker, a counter-campaign
was launched to take photographs, identify owners of the vehicles, and basically notify
their employees (with the ultimate intention of getting them fired, of course). Now, the
obvious moral issues of doxxing aside, this was one of the first instances I observed
the troubling phenomenon of online vigilantism, and what later came to be known as
_cancel culture_.

Now, many years later, cancel culture seems to be here to stay. It has led to a situation
which I’ve only experienced previously due to the looming threat of violence from a repressive
surveillance state: _self-censorship_. Netizens, people who used to risk their necks to
speak out against injustice being perpetrated by nation states, were now treating certain
subjects as off-limits, lest they be branded _“-phobes”_ and cancelled. It is truly an
unexpected low-intensity reign of terror, and unlike state actors where there might be
_some_ legal recourse/FR petition/habeas corpus/international pressure to give you at
least an iota of relief, in this case mobs accountable to no one and run by shadowy teenagers
seem to mete out justice after kangaroo trials. It sort of feels like the _JVP days_ are here
again.

So, what’s a society to do to emerge out of this mess and reclaim our right to discourse and
divergent viewpoints? I honestly don’t know, but remember that an insurgency can only survive
as long as the wider populace supports it. For far too long we’ve allowed _important online public spaces_
to be run by social media firms milking our emotions for ad revenue. They have, in turn, given
us skewed elections, body image issues, FOMO, and free reign for online bullies. This fight is
well and truly lost, **unless** we take back our spaces. We will need to demand that the firms
for whom we create so much value give us—the community—the tools to curate, moderate, and monitor
those spaces[^1]. We will need tougher regulations while guaranteeing freedom of expression, a tough
balancing act whenever governments (especially in our little corner of the world) get involved.

But, an even more pressing need will be for us as a society to come to terms with what
**is and isn’t intolerant speech**. We will have to grow up and tolerate dissenting views, and
not call for heads to roll whenever viewpoints that make us clutch our pearls come up on our feeds.

I used to believe technology could help alleviate societal problems, but I now realise that
technology is merely a _megaphone_—the voice and the words that come out of it will ultimately always
be _your own_.
