### About Me

I'm a Software Engineer from Colombo, Sri Lanka (mostly working with Javascript, PHP, Go,
and Python). I've been writing (or attempting to write) code since I was a teenager (Visual
Basic for the win!). You can find me on [Facebook][1], [LinkedIn][2], [Last.fm][3], and
[Github][4].

### About This Blog

I [started blogging][5] somewhere in early 2009, and have been writing useless blurbs of
text ever since. After having used a ton of different platforms (Blogger, Wordpress, Medium,
Tumblr etc.), I finally settled on [Pelican][6]. It has all the features you ever need[^1],
_and_ I get to feel badass by using Markdown to write stuff, and Git to commit the generated
files to be hosted on Github pages.

[^1]: Plus, it does footnotes! How cool is that?
