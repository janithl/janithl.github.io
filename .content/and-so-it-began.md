Neural Networks exam in a week!

Today's AA exam went much better than expected, given how little I studied for 
it. That kinda thing totally incentivises the wrong kind of behaviour.

What to do. I'll start with the (overdue) assignments and try to understand as
much of the *mind-boggling* math as I can.

And perhaps some day, I'd be able to do something cool like [these guys][1]:

> Reliable data on economic livelihoods remain scarce in the developing world, 
hampering efforts to study these outcomes and to design policies that improve 
them. Here we demonstrate an accurate, inexpensive, and scalable method for 
estimating consumption expenditure and asset wealth from high-resolution 
satellite imagery. Using survey and satellite data from five African 
countries—Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, and Rwanda—we show how a 
convolutional neural network can be trained to identify image features that can 
explain up to 75% of the variation in local-level economic outcomes. Our method, 
which requires only publicly available data, could transform efforts to track 
and target poverty in developing countries. It also demonstrates how powerful 
machine learning techniques can be applied in a setting with limited training 
data, suggesting broad potential application across many scientific domains.
