Am I doomed
To an existence
Where you
You, you, _and you_
(Yes, I know you're all the sameâ€”
though it took me a while to catch on)
Will be near enough to see
But never to hold?
Always tantalisingly close
But no cigar?
To check up on
After a hard day
To celebrate your wins
(Not that you'll never know)
Applaud, be proud of,
Have imaginary conversations with
Late into the night
Am I doomed
To _exist_?
