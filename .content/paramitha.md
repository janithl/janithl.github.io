One week ago, on 7 March, I released my animated short _Paramitha_.
I stared working on it in early February and just as I expected
it took ~4 weeks of work to finish. I used [Krita][1] for the
drawing and frame-by-frame animations, and [Synfig Studio][2] for
things like parallax.

The story and setting were inspired by a random piece I did a
while back (I think I just liked the background!)

### Storyboard and Animation

I first started with a storyboard, and then animated it to get an
idea of the timing and "beats":

Very rough storyboard animation:

I did a lot of rough renders to explore ideas and get a feel for my
capabilities as an animator. This was my first short and I didn't want
to bite off more than I could chew.

The walk cycles were a major part of the animation. I do wish I could've
spent a little bit more time on them, as they were animated on fours and
would've looked much better if animated on twos.

I deviated from the storyboard somewhat by adding two additional
shots that were inspired by seeing how reflections were animated,
and the idea of a "journey" was used in anime. So, the bus scene
came into existence:

### Parallax

For parallax shots, which I employed a lot, the scene would broken
down into multiple semi-transparent layers in Krita and exported as
PNGs, which I would then animate in Synfig Studio. This allowed me
to make the layers closer to the camera move faster, giving the
illusion of depth in a scene.

### Sound

Finally, in the final two days of production (a weekend) I worked on
the sound design and making a theme. [Audacity][3] was a great help
during this. I wanted a female voice for the Buddhist chant (to fit the
character), but running short of time and people I could ask, I created
a chorus of voices chanting by recording it myself. For the theme, I
created a very simple droning, Eastern-inspired guitar and bass piece
in D major and C major.

For the bird sounds, which added a lot of ambiance, I used two recordings:
[a recording of Rose-ringed Parakeet sounds by Marie-Lan Taÿ Pamart][4],
and [a recording of Common Mynas by L. Shyamal][5]. Both these birds are
commonly found in Sri Lanka.

And that's how it was done. Given how it was my first time making
something, and the fact that I had to learn so much on the job, I'm
very happy with how it turned out. The film and music are released
