<p class="text-center">Cheng Xin in space</p>

I recently finished [the last book][1] in Liu Cixin's masterpiece trilogy, and
created this little piece in Krita.

Cheng Xin's name translates to _sincerity_. This single character gets so much
flak from fans of the trilogy, and gets hated far more than even genuine
villains. But everything she did, she did out of a sense of duty, out of genuine
love. She never used her vast riches or power for personal gain, but to save others.

**P.S.** There _wouldn't be a staircase project_ without her genius. Or intelligence
encoded inside fairy tales if she didn't risk her life to fetch it without a moment's
hesitation. Or even food for Yun Tianming. 🤷🏽‍♀️
