With any sufficiently complex system, a major overhaul always creates 
more problems than it solves; there's enough and more "case studies" of
the type you read about in *Software Engineering* to back it up. Things 
that were fixed over years and countless late night hacking sessions and 
painstaking iterations break and you have to fix them again.

The wisest programmer I've ever met once said that software development 
at scale is all about *"letting go"*. I won't say I'm anywhere near 
that level of Zen, but I'm certainly much less OCD about the giant fire 
in the room. It's a pointless to make reversing entropy your life's work.
