*So this is February*

*And what have you done?*

*Another year's started*

*No strategic planning was begun*

Is that how the song goes?

I finally left my job of a few months over four years and am currently in the twilight
zone (?) or whatever they call it.

I also did something very uncharacteristic and went out and bought myself something, a
budget Stratocaster. I don't really play the guitar enough to justify this, and fully 
blame Rob Chapman and Lee Anderton for making me do it.

I think I *might* going through a full-on midlife crisis.

I've also started binging BoJack Horseman, which has gems like these:

> You know, sometimes I feel like I was born with a leak, and any goodness I started with
just slowly spilled out of me, and now it's all gone. And I'll never get it back in me.
It's too late. Life is a series of closing doors, isn't it?

Not the greatest show to be watching if you're ever in that place where you're not really
sure if you're a good person, and nothing new is happening and you feel like you're
coasting on *that one time* you did well (a long long time ago...)

Anywayyy, this wasn't supposed to be *that* negative (you should've seen the first draft)
so we'll wind up here. This means more regular updates on the blog again, hopefully!
