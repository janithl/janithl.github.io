![6 Percenters]({filename}/images/6-percent.png)

**Disclaimer:** I did my undergraduate studies at a private fee-levying 
university in Sri Lanka.

The above disclaimer reflects my natural sympathies in this fight. It 
was easy to support the private university cause, simply because:

1. Not everyone can get into state universities (in the academic year 
2013, only 16.5% of eligible students were afforded placements according 
to the UGC)

2. The rich-enough will look for uni placements abroad

3. The not-rich-enough-to-go-abroad (like me) would end up without any 
means to get tertiary education (if not for private universities)

4. The [*anthare*][1] makes it hard not to hate them.

Simple argument, simple logical conclusion: allow private universities.

This was the entirety of my view on the argument, circa 2010 - 2014. At 
the time I was also strongly libertarian.

Well, it's 2016. The world has changed, and my views have matured and 
become more nuanced. <s>I have become a BernieBro</s>

It's increasingly clear that student debt is a problem that does not go 
away, and that there are serious flaws with not only the financials, but 
the entire structure and role of tertiary education institutions. Are 
liberal arts worth teaching any longer? Is graduate employability and 
salaries the only measure of success for a programme?

I digress.

My point is that I now think that tertiary education *should* be 
considered a student right that should be provided for by the state, and 
that it should be available to all eligible students.

* I am still 100% pro letting **all** eligible students get university 
education, **not just 16.5%**. There would be no need for convoluted 
z-score schemes and the *anthare* feeling all superior to people who 
lost out on admission by a fraction of a percentage point.

* I am not naive enough to assume the government will foot the bill for 
this 6-fold increase. A public-private partnership with scholarship 
funds etc. will need to be set up.

* I am painfully aware, through my own experience and those of my peers, 
of just how mercenary a vast number of private educational institutions 
are.

* I am also aware how expensive education is, and that not everyone can 
afford it. Poverty not standing in the way of opportunity, which is the 
greatest triumph of our [Kannangara][2] system, should be defended at 
all cost.

* There are also plenty of kids who *can* afford to pitch in and pay a 
bit. They should be able to contribute and support their peers who 
can't.

* Where applicable, student loans should have [25 - 30 year repayment 
periods][3].

> Yet despite this widespread borrowing, there is no student debt 
crisis in Sweden, because payments are spread out over 25 years. They 
also start out low, rising slowly over time. [...] In Germany, students 
pay their loans over 20 years; in England, itâ€™s 30 years. 
> 
> This makes sense. A core principle of finance is that the length of 
debt payments should align with the life of the asset. We pay for cars 
over five years and homes over 30 years because homes last a lot longer 
than cars. An education pays off over a lifetime, so it makes sense that 
student loans should be paid off over a long term.

There is no need (nor is this an endorsement) to pre-emptively *ban* all 
private universities, but a sufficient public option should exist for 
all interested students (which I wager is most of them).

There are serious issues in the state university system right now (from 
under-paid lecturers, to strikes, to lack of research output, to 
[academic inbreeding][4]), and the GMOA's self-serving agenda (and using 
medical students as pawns to further that agenda) invokes nothing but 
disgust. 

But the people of this country should, for once, look at the core issues 
surrounding our tertiary education system and try to fix them at the 
root, instead of palming it off to the private sector and forgetting 
about it.
