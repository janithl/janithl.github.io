you fall in love

over a phone call

in the backseat of the cinema

reading whatsapps at 1 am

at a candle lit dinner

or when you're the first to hear about their day

&nbsp;

you fall in love

every time you work out

or take a good shower

sit down to write a new song

or learn something new

and not because someone asked you to

&nbsp;

is one really any better than the other?

can the first even exist in a void?
