I created this little timeline graphic as a crutch for my non-American self trying
to navigate the complex history, culture, and inter-network rivalries of American
Late Night TV shows.

There are some shows that should be mentioned but aren’t, because they weren’t on
the big three:

1. [The Late Show][1]/[The Joan Rivers Show][2]
2. [The Arsenio Hall Show][3]
3. [The Jon Stewart Show][4] on MTV
4. The various syndicated versions of [The Dick Cavett Show][5]
5. [The Daily Show][6] and [The Colbert Report][7] on Comedy Central (Stewart says
   Letterman called them the “cable twins”)
6. [Conan][8] on TBS (my current favourite)
