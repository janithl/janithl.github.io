I am alive and... _well?_ I don’t know much about quantifying wellness,
but in the age of a pandemic I feel lucky to be healthy. There hasn’t
been much activity in this blog not just because I have been busy (work
really took over life in quarantine), but because I have had a lot to
say but no way to say it.

Pandy life has upended a lot of what we take for granted, and made us
reevaluate a lot of what we considered foundational to our being in the
pre-Covid era. Human connections and the directions of our lives and how
we spend “social” time is among them. Now, don’t get me wrong, I still
love my friends, but this time apart without any face-to-face contact (I
last saw them in October! **It’s been 8 months!**) has been difficult for
everyone. It also made me consider what friendships entail and how far
we are willing to go to maintain friendships.

It also made me suddenly realise how small my social circle is. Now, my
intentional limiting of social media usage was not much of a concern
pre-pandemic, but as the weeks of social distancing turned into months
I started regretting my choices just a little bit. However, seeing the
toxicity on most platforms these days also made me realise why I decided
to cut the cord when I did.

This period of forced introspection (hah, as if I needed an excuse to look
inward) has also made me more and more aware of the central conflict in my
life: that between the _deen_ and the _dunya_. The _lokottara_ versus the
_laukika_. Do I really want my hopeless romanticism to finally culminate
in the life of a householder—with wife and children in tow—or do I want
to make the best of (what I honestly believe) is an infinitesimally rare
opportunity to break the cycle of samsara?

I know this post is disjointed and sounds like the the ramblings of an
_ummattaka_ (because _සබ්බේ සත්තා උම්මත්තකෝ_ right?), but I need this as a
waypoint to look back at someday and convince myself that whatever choice
I made here was correct.

And till that day, happy journeying to you all.
