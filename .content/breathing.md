*'Cause I am hanging on every word you say*

*And even if you don't want to speak tonight*

*That's alright, alright with me...*

Today's been a bit of an off-day. In the last few days I've a couple of 
interesting Medium posts. Highlights:

> A healthy product company is, confusingly, one at odds with itself. 
There is a healthy part which is attempting to normalize and to create 
predictability, and there needs to be another part that is tasked with 
building something new that is going to disrupt and eventually destroy 
that normality.

> Failure to create some form of predictability will result in chaos. 
Failure to create some well-maintained Barbaric chaos inside the company 
guarantees that a fast-moving, ambitious, risk-taking and ruthless someone 
else — someone outside the company will invade because they know what you 
forgot: hacking is important.

> We’ve recently moved to a more “hip” location. We used to have personal 
desks, but now we have this “pick whatever spot is avaiable” open area. I 
dislike it a lot.

Progress has been slow on the research papers I'm supposed to be reading, so 
I picked up watching (the 7th season, which I've missed so far, of) Archer 
instead. I will attempt, today, to print some slides and prepare for the 
lectures I have tomorrow. 

I inadvertently opined on some work-related matters (*bad me*) because I ran 
into my co-workers yesterday and we engaged in a bit of shop-talk. Whoops. I
just pointed at an [old standard](https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html) 
that I live by and hoped that it wasn't too intrusive of me to get involved. 
Again, *bad me*.

And the reason we all met was: **MALINTHE TURNED 26!** We're all getting 
really old now, eh? The thing was excellent, though Whight's other patrons 
might've not defined it as such, due to how *quiet* our table was. Yes, 
we're always *those* people when we're together.

That concludes my useless update for the day, stay tuned for more daily tripe.
