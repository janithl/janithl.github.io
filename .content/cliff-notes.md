It doesn’t go away. None of it does. No matter how kind or forgiving
you are, the stains of the _‘bad times’_ stay on like fountain pen
ink on white fabric, refusing to budge. All they need is some mild
reoccurrence to go full-on #ThrowbackThursday

Am I a bad person? Was she a bad person? Do we tell each other that
we’re good people to avoid the painful truth that maybe we weren’t
good to each other? That we did things that were downright mean, but
always with the cover of “but I _meant_ well”.
_Cetanaham bhikkhave kammam vadami,_ but does the intent lessen the
pain of the person suffering?

People rarely are what they seem on the surface, and that includes yourself.
You know, it doesn’t matter how good your unit test suite is if the train
tracks don’t line up and your integrations fail? It’s the same with people.
No matter how much you think you know yourself, it takes deep, meaningful
and prolonged interaction with another to know what you’re _really_ like.

Do you ever worry that they’ll never appreciate you for who you are? That
you’ll never match up to the version of you in their heads? That they’ll
never know the _why_ of your quirks and your ideals, or worse, they’ll
never _care_?

_Esto Perpetua_. I only got to attend that good school for two years, but the
motto will always stay with me because it spoke to my soul. Be thou forever.
Don’t be afraid to be your own true self, warts and all. Life is too short to
be constantly feel like you’re walking on eggshells, hiding away parts of your
_being_, and isolating yourself from the people and activities that meant things
to you. Nothing, and no one, is worth that.
