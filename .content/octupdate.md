Well, I expected this deluge of werk werk werk to sweep me off my feet, 
but it has been pretty thoroughly overwhelming to get back in the 
saddle. In the last two weeks I have encountered highs and lows that 
staying at home comfortably cushioned me from for weeks, got food 
poisoning, and went back to my role as office plumber-in-chief. My god, 
**so much plumbing**, and so much more to go.

There's so much (loud) activity in the office that Mal and I had to seek 
refuge downstairs to get work done.

The traffic has gotten totes ridics now, you can't find a bus with seats 
at 1930 any more. Or hope to get home within the hour. Total *ඔබට 
සතුටුයිද දැන්* situation.

And to top it off I had to go drink a buttermilk and it gave me the 
shits.

Such is life.
