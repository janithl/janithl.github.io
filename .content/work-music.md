_Or rather: a history of what I’ve worked on over the years through the music I was listening to at the time._

### 2011: Live Forever — Oasis

These were the heady days of youthful exuberance, when any idea seemed
like it was worth pursuing — all the world’s problems could be solved
with code, y’know? — and the internet was new, exciting, and as yet
relatively uncommercialised. I was going through a major Britpop phase
and this anthem seemed to best capture the spirit of the age.

> Maybe you’re the same as me  
> We see things they’ll never see  
> You and I are gonna live forever

There were no limits back then, no wary old voice at the back of your
head saying _“someone must’ve written a library for this before”_, or
_“if this is worth anything Google would’ve done it already”._ Bus route
finders and blog aggregators just sprung up, with hopelessly naive yet
somehow (barely) functioning code that got the job done.

### 2012: A Certain Romance — Arctic Monkeys

My final year of uni was happening, and there was a real chance of me failing.

In retrospect, this might’ve been an overreaction to the statement by a
lecturer that last year’s batch had done awfully, and half had flunked their
finals. But I was fed up of the years of uni I’d already been through, and
wanted to finally be a salaryman. No chances were hence taken, and no quarter
given. From the end of the day’s lecturers right up until 8 PM when the library
closed down, I would be in there studying. Every. Single. Day.

There were some perks. Pretty librarians, and even prettier girls. Nothing
(obviously) came of it, but I got introduced to a lot of good music: Hendrix,
Clapton, and the Monkeys from Sheffield. I still consider their debut album
— chronicling a night out clubbing— one of the finest ever crafted. Alex Turner
was barely 20 at the time.

> Well over there, there’s friends of mine  
> What can I say? I’ve known ’em for a long long time  
> And yeah they might overstep the line  
> But I just cannot get angry in the same way  
> Not in the same way

Oh, and I passed. :)

### 2017: Don’t Stop — Fleetwood Mac

> Was it even a **break up** if you didn’t listen to **Rumours**
> by **Fleetwood Mac** at least 6 times?

I was trudging through my second job like a British tax inspector through a cold
thunderstorm. The project I was working through had been through 6 weeks of hell
and back — all to deliver a product that would’ve taken _n_ number of weeks in
_half the time_, all because it had been sold to the client as something that
could be done.

Everyone involved in that sales pitch had disappeared, and a team of mostly
greenhorns had to spend late nights and weekends, clocking up 100-hour weeks for
this impossible goal. There was a week where I had spent 6 midnights in a row at
the office. We’d go home at 2 AM (on a good day) and be back at work at 9 AM for
the morning client call with the team in Brisbane.

As 2017 ended, and I spent Christmas ‘holidays’ in an empty office working, my
mind was set on quitting as soon as possible. The only thing keeping me going
were the breakup songs playing through my tinny headset.

<p class="text-center">Everyone needs some of that coke in their lives.</p>

> If you wake up and don’t want to smile  
> If it takes just a little while  
> Open your eyes and look at the day  
> You’ll see things in a different way

> Don’t stop thinking about tomorrow  
> Don’t stop, it’ll soon be here  
> It’ll be, better than before  
> Yesterday’s gone, yesterday’s gone

### 2018: Renu Renu — Rookantha Gunathilake

2018 was an year of catharsis in many ways. I was able to leave my second job
and transition to my third, work with a group of people whom I enjoy being
around, and work at my own pace. I listen to a lot of Rookantha and [Synthwave][1]
these days, when I need to get deep work done and block out the distractions of the
co-working space we operate out of.

_Renu Renu_ is the 7th track from Roo’s seminal 1988 release [_Bambara Pahasa_][2].
With such evergreen hits like the title track, the patriotic anthem _Indunil Gangulel_,
_Sithin Sina Sisi_ (one of my favourite love songs ever), _Anatha Maruthe_,
_Suwanda Dena Mal Wane_ and _Lande Mula Wee_, the _Bambara Pahasa_ cassette (which I
grew up listening to) marked a high point in the Sri Lankan popular music industry.

One year later, its greatest ever songwriter Premakeerthi de Alwis was killed in the
midst of an extremely gruesome war between Marxist insurgents and government death squads
that were ready to match and amplify the savagery, marking the start of a slow but steady
decline in both the commercial reach and the artistic achievements of the industry.

As for the work itself — it isn’t the most exciting in the world. I’m no longer working
with the latest cutting-edge tech and writing code in a language that came out 6 months
ago and Babel transpiles into 16 different varieties of Javascript, but sometimes
_boring is good_.

This beautiful track is like 3-songs-in-one. Also, Rupavahini should bring back
Saxophonists in naval suits.

> රේණු රේණු මල් මිටේ රේණු  
> ඈට පෙම් කරන්න මට බෑලු  
> රන් සමනල තටු මට ලැබෙන්නෙ නෑලු  
> රොන් පිරී සැලෙන්න මල් රේණු

> සඳවත දෝ මා දුටුවේ  
> ඔබෙ ගත දෝ මා දුටුවේ  
> සිතුවම් දෝ මා දුටුවේ  
> හැබැහින් දෝ ඔබ දුටුවේ
