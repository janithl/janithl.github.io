Subtitle: Time to put my Gaomon face on!

I've been eyeing a graphics tablet for a while now, and on 11.11 there was this gorgeous
[Gaomon S620][1] for just $22 (!!!) on AliExpress, an offer I simply couldn't refuse.
Well, the tab arrived in the mail today, and I want to share some of my experiments on
my first day of digital art!

The first few attempts (above) were predictably terrible, but I began realising that my
usual [sketching][2] and watercolouring techniques weren't the best match for the medium,
because digital was something else entirely! As I told Dili, "it's like working with clay,
I can mould this shit all day". And that was my lightbulb moment, the fact that I can
mould the light and shadows to create shapes.

It's been a lot of fun, and this next piece took only 45 minutes. Having an undo button,
an eraser, and all the brushes in the world is definitely expanding the possibilities
for my limited artistic ability. It's like giving FL Studio to a kid who wants to write
music but can't play an instrument[^1].

Also, shout-out to [FireAlpaca][3], the awesome free editor I've been using to draw these.
It's been very cool and I've barely even scratched its surface, feature-wise.
