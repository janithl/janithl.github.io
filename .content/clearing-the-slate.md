I like blank slates, and I like closure.

My JIRA board at work has a bunch of stubborn tickets that won't go
away. This seems to mirror life in general, in that the peace that I
seek, of finally finishing what I've been working on, seems to be
drifting further away the more I run towards it.

It's been a crazy year, and this is the fourth draft of a post that I've
been writing since the middle of August. Just like the music and paintings
I've been working on, I kept hitting a wall where what I wanted to say, and
what I was capable of saying diverged. I'm just tired at this point. I've
tried to be proactive in a year in which that sort of thing just wasn't
meant to be. Talk about a bad _nekatha_.

It's time to take a deep breath, lie down, and take a well-deserved rest.
