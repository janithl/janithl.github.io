Instalment 2 of the "sharing links" thingy. Shorter too.

**On Software:**

I recently subscribed to the Dataquest newsletter, and today got this post
emailed to me:

[*Python vs R: head to head data analysis*][1]

> Make pairwise scatterplots: One common way to explore a dataset is to see how 
different columns correlate to others.

![Seaborn Pairplot]({filename}/images/seaborn-pairplot.png)

The above example is from the excellent [Seaborn Documentation][2]. Good stuff!

**On Conflict:**

I read several great D. B. S. Jeyaraj articles in my ongoing fascination with
the Sri Lankan Civil War.

[*“Pottu Amman” and the Intelligence Division of the LTTE*][3]

> He was amazed at Pottu’s growth in later life and observed “I just don’t know 
how he is running the intelligence division so well nowadays”. But then academic 
brilliance is not a pre-requisite to run an intelligence outfit.

> What is required is lateral thinking, practical approaches, devious cunning, 
organizational skills, shrewd judgement of men and matters and above all 
perpetual paranoia about everything.

[*“Col Charles”: The ”tiger” Mastermind Behind LTTE Attacks Outside 
North-East*][4]

> It was decided that Colombo should be taught a bitter lesson. Charles, then 
only nineteen was entrusted with the task. He moved into Colombo in January 1991 
and set two plans of attack in motion. Within a few weeks the LTTE struck in 
Colombo. The JOC headquarters was blown up. Ranjan Wijeratne was killed by a car 
bomb. This was only the beginning. Charles as an “unknown face” of the LTTE 
remained incognito in Colombo till 1997.

How inept was military intel at that time for this guy to lurk around for almost
7 years blowing shit up and not be noticed?

**On Economics:**

The excellent piece on the Daily FT by IPS Chairman Prof. Razeen Sally, titled 
[*"The Sri Lankan economy after regime change"*][5]

> First the Government hammers consumers with high prices through inflation and 
import taxes – which hits the poor particularly hard since they spend more of 
their disposable income on essential items. Then it bludgeons producers with 
price controls. This is market-busting, an echo of Mrs Bandaranaike’s command 
economy in the 1970s.

On the same old wine in new bottles:

> Old, established politicians have played musical chairs around the cabinet 
table, and kept a new generation of younger, competent professionals away from 
positions of power. This is not surprising: the old political elite – and their 
business cronies – have vested interests to defend. And so entrenched, 
unprofessional, bankrupt attitudes and methods persist.

On tax reform:

> Objectives should be to get revenue up to 15-20% of GDP, while concurrently 
increasing incentives to save, invest, create jobs and boost productivity. The 
watchword should be “simplification”. There should be clean, simple rates for 
VAT and direct (personal and corporate) income taxes, with as few exemptions as 
possible. [...] Even relatively low tax rates will generate more revenue 
providing the system is clean, simple and well-enforced.

On the possible repercussions of this government failing:

> The more malign scenario is that the present situation will spiral backwards. 
A macroeconomic crisis might be the catalyst. Or it could result from popular 
frustrations – no new investments, no new jobs, no change – boiling over. Then, 
in the Sinhala-Buddhist heartland, people might yearn again for a Big Man, a 
Rajapaksa or someone else, to ride in and clean house, sweeping away liberal 
rights and democratic niceties with his authoritarian broom. They could vent 
their frustrations at the minorities who got President Sirisena and a UNP-led 
Government elected.

Hat tip for [Yudhanjaya][6] and [Himal][7] for pointing me at this.

I've been watching a LOT of "Crash Course World History", and I loved their 
[*episode on Imperialism*][8], especially the oft-overlooked economic side of 
it. See also [their episode on American Imperialism][9], mostly covering the 
Spanish-American War.

Well, I guess not that much shorter. Oh well.
