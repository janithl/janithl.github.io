*Why her though?*

She's...

*Not your type? At all?*

And what *is* my type, again?

*Not her*

Right.

*Come on, dude. I've known you since we had other people wash our bums for us.
She's so not your type*

Well, we're grown-ups now. Shouldn't we look past "types" and all those
primitive constructs. I like her for who she is.

*Or you like her who who she makes you...*

What?

*Oh, you know. Saves you from your eternal fear of ending up with a... simpleton*

Heh.

*Look, you barely know her. In the past few days, from what I've seen, you've
been using that blank canvas to project your hopes and dreams*

Dude. Too much truth on a Monday morning.

*She's your ticket to legitimacy, the girl who reads, and knows, and speaks
well. She's funny, and beautiful, and you know she's going to be on the top of
the world one day. The ultimate Manic Pixie Dream Girl for nerds who actually
want them to be a bit less dreamy and a bit less manic...*

Now I ain't sayin' I'm a gold digger, but I ain't messin' with no...

*Look, all I'm saying is that she deserves better than to be blank canvas, or a 
trophy, no? She deserves to be her own woman, and you need to start seeing any 
person you'll be with as an equal, not as a stepping stone for your own...*

Zip it, Sherlock. I think they've all stopped reading at this point...

*Ah, it seems so.*
