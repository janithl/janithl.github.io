Here's a small recap of what I've been watching on the ol' YouTube.

### Practical Engineering

[Grady Hillhouse][1] just has the most calming presence on screen, and he
explains complex engineering concepts with simple practical setups. His series’
on [concrete][2], [hydraulics][3], and [the power grid][4] are not only
information-packed but witty as well.

#### See Also:

[**Technology Connections**][5]: The old faithful when you want to learn way
too much about anything from [Christmas lights][6] to [VHS tapes][7].

[**City Beautiful**][8]: The channel that city-design-obsessed teenage me would’ve
love to have had growing up. He covers everything from [Soviet city design][9],
to [Vancouverism][10].

### Scott Manly

[This man][11] has single-handedly reignited (like an Agena upper stage) my long-lost
passion for rocketry and space exploration. He covers everything from the history
of [the Soyuz][12] to the [latest SpaceX breakthroughs][13].

#### See Also:

[**Copenhagen Suborbitals**][14]: If DIY rockets are your thing, check out this private
European setup attempting to send a human into orbit!

### Johnny Harris

[Vox’s Borders might be cancelled][15], but that won’t stop Johnny from talking about a
border dispute [between the US and Canada][16]. Or [Switzerland’s explosive neutrality][17].
Or just [_the_ most amazing international breakfasts][18].

#### See Also:

[**His lovely wife Iz**][19]: She makes videos for Eater, and [her series on Taiwan][20]
was just breathtakingly good.

### Rick Beato

[The OG music producer YouTuber][21]. Today, he has [an amazing interview up with Steve Jordan][22].
His [_What Makes This Song Great_ series][23] has got me in trouble in the past because I
paid more attention to it than the other people in my life.

#### See Also:

[**Adam Neely**][24]: His [video on _The Girl From Impanema_][25] is just an instant classic.

[**12Tone**][26]: One of my longest subs. I wake up every Saturday awaiting a breakdown of
[what makes Uptown Funk so catchy][27], or why the [Yamaha E-Piano tone][28] stand out so much.

[**Keen on Keys**][29]: This is such a great channel that deserves a whole post of its own.
Check out the amazing [PortaSound PS-3 video][30], or the [one on the HS-200/HS-500][31], or
the [Casio MT-40/MT-41 video][32]. Such an [amazing musician][33], and videos with
professional-level production quality.

And so, those are my favourite subscriptions at the moment. I find myself watching YouTube
more now that I work from home and I upgraded my data plan. This has (predictably) led to
less time for longer-form video content, which honestly I am okay with.
