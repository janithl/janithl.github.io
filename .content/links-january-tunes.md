2020 has been an interesting year musically, so here are some of my
favourite music this year.

### Theo Katzman

Vulf wunderkind Theo's album, "Modern Johnny Sings: Songs in the Age
of Vibe", has been the talk of the town.

### Cory Wong

Speaking of Vulf alum, Cory's album "Elevator Music for an Elevated Mood"
is also the talk of the town, with bangers such as ["Team Sports"][1].
There's also this crazy collab with Dave Koz[^1]:

Cory comments on the video:

> "Dave, can u sit in a directors chair for this one?"

> "What?"

> "Yea they've got a directors chair...can u sit in it"

> "Wait, what song?"

> "Read this chart, you'll know exactly what to do...i'll take the solo"

> "Why aren't you wearing shoes"

> "Alright we got the 2200 grit sandpaper out, Koz is in the building..."

> TAKE 1 RELEASED ON ALBUM

It blows my mind how good these session regulars/legends are.

### Ryan Lerman/Scary Pockets/Stories/Pomplamoose

Ryan has been putting out a ton of music both from the Scary Pockets
channel as well as the new Stories series. There's this amazing Bieber
cover featuring Antwaun Stanley:

(featuring Sam Wilkes on the Fender Whistle):

Plenty of cool featured artists on Stories including
[Arlissa covering John Mayer][2], and [Nataly Dawn covering MGMT][3]. Nataly
has also been recording an album of French language covers, including the
following iconic tune:

Just aww! :')

### And, finally

This doesn't count as a 'tune', but it would be criminal to leave this off
the listâ€”Paul Davids and Samurai "Sammy G" Guitarist collab to blow our minds:
