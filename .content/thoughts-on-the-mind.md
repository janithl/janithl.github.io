The mind is a fascinating thing that is little understood and often ignored.

We believe we have mastered it like we've mastered walking, or playing an 
instrument, or typing, or speech. But it is fundamentally uncontrollable and 
has a "mind of its own". Har har.

Making the fundamental error of announcing your plans before you implement them
can cause your brain to reward you before you've accomplished anything, and 
therefore leads you to [not accomplish those plans at all][1]:

> Research conducted by Peter Gollwitzer has shown that individuals feel closer 
to having achieved their identity goals when their identity-relevant activities 
(e.g., attending medical school) are noticed by others. On the basis of this 
work, Gollwitzer and his colleagues hypothesized that even if others notice 
only our plans for identity-relevant activities, we might also feel closer to 
having achieved our identity goals. Because we then feel closer to having 
achieved our identity goals, we may feel less of a need to actually enact those 
behaviours

I'm finding out first hand how frustrating this can be, at the moment.
