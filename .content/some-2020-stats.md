There no getting around the fact that 2020 was defined by the pandemic. With that
in mind, some personal stats:

### Transport

In 2018, I took 556 bus rides. [In 2019, I took 265.][1]

In 2020, I took 15. Not a typo. 14 rides in January and a solitary ride in February.
With the threat of Covid rising (even before the government decided to finally
lockdown in March), I didn’t risk taking cramped public transport. Sadly, I also
understand that working from home and taking a PickMe are not privileges everyone
has access to.

A breakdown of all rides taken in 2020 clearly reflect the two waves/lockdowns we
had this year in Sri Lanka:

These are the ride counts and average fares for 2020 in comparison to 2019:

| Type       | Count (2019) | Avg (2019) | Count (2020) | Avg (2020) | Count Diff | Avg Diff |
| ---------- | -----------: | ---------: | -----------: | ---------: | ---------: | -------: |
| **Bus**    |          265 |      21.91 |           15 |      27.53 |       -250 |     5.62 |
| **PickMe** |          245 |     394.35 |          102 |     349.25 |       -143 |   -45.10 |
| **Tuk**    |           29 |     356.21 |           12 |     256.83 |        -17 |   -99.38 |
| **Uber**   |            5 |     500.00 |            1 |      50.00 |         -4 |  -450.00 |
| **Total**  |      **544** |            |      **130** |            |   **-414** |          |

### The Blog

I published 16 posts in 2020, down from 18 in 2019. It’s still not hitting my ideal
of 24 (posting twice a month), but I’ll take it:

### Art/Music

[Chithrapotha is rolling on][2], with 55 posts this year. This is nowhere near the 27
I posted in just over a month when I started it, but I put more effort to finish
pieces now and can never finish them at a rate of one-a-day like I used to.

On SoundCloud [I only managed 8 tracks this year][3] (down from [18 in 2019][4]),
mostly due to my recording setup getting fudged by an OS upgrade back in June.
Hopefully, with the new year—and planned hardware upgrades—I’ll be back to recording
a ton of tracks that have piled up on my phone’s voice recording app.

So, those are my 2020 stats. [It’s not been a great year][5], but I’m well aware that
things could’ve been much worse—and I’m grateful for good health and still having all
my loved ones with me.

I sincerely hope 2021 will be a good year for you and yours!
