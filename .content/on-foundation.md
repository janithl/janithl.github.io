I finished Isaac Asimov's seminal work, the first book of the [Foundation trilogy][1],
yesterday. This is [my short review][2] that I added on Goodreads:

---

I think it's a bit harsh to rate this book using modern standards when it was
written in the 1940s. Yes, it's not as fast paced or as expansive as modern SciFi,
and there is a woeful lack of female characters (only one gets a speaking part).
But modern SciFi didn't exist when Asimov wrote this, and so much of it even to
this day draws from the vein Asimov struck (the parallels with the Star Wars universe
a few decades later is notable, for example).

Instead, it might be a good idea to look at where Asimov himself drew inspiration
from: Edward Gibbon's [_The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire_][3].
Basically, we can class the work as a _space history_, concerning how vast empires
decay, how the people living in the midst of such empires experience this fall much
more differently than the people living in the peripheries, and how opportunists
come for the scraps. One wonders how Asimov predicted so well the work of the oligarchs
and pocket dictators after the fall of his native Soviet Union, and fifty years before
the fact.

What I found strikingly modern though are its takes on religion as a means of social
control, ivory tower academics who were unconcerned with all but dogma while the Rome
that sustained their work burned around them, and how societies tend to reject
science and technology it doesn't understand-a theme that reverberates well in
today's post-Covid world.
