Done using the usual process. Pencil on paper, inked with an Atlas 
Chooty Gel, and photographed.

It's then cleaned up in GIMP, and traced into a vector in Inkscape, 
resulting in an outline:

Then reimported into GIMP, coloured, and highlights and shadows added.

I've done a Luke and switched from a blue lightsaber to a green one.
I've also forgotten to add the beard, and the legs look atrocious, but
such is life for a nooblet at drawing.
