<p class="text-center">Yes, but can Liberals batter down doors anymore?</p>

Last night, dealing with a bought of insomnia, [I read this important take on BoJo][2]
(not to be confused with BoJack) and the conservative wave sweeping across not just the
UK but most of the world. While there might be a few points of contention, I think
overall it was a good state of the union on liberalism and what I like to think is a
bit of a disease among educated liberals: the refusal and lack of confidence in pushing
our agenda.

<p class="text-center text-muted">* * *</p>

Born at the tail end of the Berlin Wall and the Soviet Union, my generation was very
liberal and expected the generations that followed us to be even more so. The online
communities where we came of age were incredibly inclusive, liberal, and _"woke"_. And
yet, woke culture itself overextended and exposed the flanks, leading to the almost
_unthinkable_ scenario of an incredibly right-leaning younger generation, and the liberal
and free thinking communities of our youth turned to the right as a reaction to the
seeming _authoritarianism of the new left_.

The _yoofs_ were also very much multiculturally aware, having grown up with access to
different _lived experiences_ via the internet, and very much sensitive to what it saw as
liberal intolerances of differing opinions, as well as seeming mollycoddling of the more
bigoted minorities within minorities. To the kids growing up on Gangam Style, it was no
longer western values at stake but an overarching global value structure[^1] which was
threatened not by the traditional scapegoat of crusty and rich old conservatives[^2], but
by increasingly intolerant, tone deaf, preachy ivory tower PC liberals.  

<p class="text-center text-muted">* * *</p>

Long story short: Even though there is a lot of hope left in the world and its youth (in
the form of e.g. Greta Thunberg, CAA protestors in Indian universities, and the younger
remain voters at the Brexit polls), it is still disheartening to see some in such an educated
and informed generation turn towards reactionism over progressivism.

For the libs, it is time to regroup and look inward. We must reflect on the past decade, the
victories (MARRIAGE EQUALITY!) and the bitter defeats, and consider what we value the most,
what our core inviolable principles are. Lines might have to be drawn where our usual support
for personal preferences and freedoms infringe on the rights of the other and the collective[^3].
It is time to raise those voices in battle cries, as the rich keep becoming richer, and use
their money and influence to sow division among the working man to further their own ends. We
don't have much time—the greed of our race has set the planet on fire. The rich will burrow
underneath and survive, but what of us poor proles? 

<p class="text-center text-muted">* * *</p>

It is time to step away from books and back into society. It's time to make welfare great again,
fight for unionisation and the rights of the worker and the downtrodden. Come to the understanding
that humanity isn't perfect, but that we must struggle to make this planet and our society better,
more equitable and more inclusive.

It's time to bring back civil discourse, please, and thank you. No one likes being talked down to,
or being called racist because they were simply well-meaning but ignorant. Bring back the humanity,
bring back the fight, bring back Travellers on the Discovery Channel. Shout from the rooftops
_how awesome science is_, and how excited we are about exploring outer space, reforesting our
planet, or curing disease. Stand against bigotry, while also acknowledging that bigotry is bigotry
regardless of the source. [As the great Imtiaz Bakeer Markar once said][3]:

> Think not in terms of _who_ is right and who is wrong, but _what_ is right and what is wrong.

[^1]:  I would argue this dates back to enlightenment thinking and classical liberalism.

[^2]: Still very much the actual villain—see Prince Andrew.

[^3]: I personally do not believe it is a zero sum game. Living in a republic is based on a
social contract, and some individualistic excesses might have to be forgone in the service of cohesion.
