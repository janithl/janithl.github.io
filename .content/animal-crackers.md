![Animal Crackers by Richard de Zoysa]({filename}/images/animal-crackers.png)

Thimal is making me read [Richard de Zoysa][1]'s work.

Back when the dictator in chief cared about what was written in English about the
government, and dissent was treated with abduction, torture and a gunshot to the back of
the head (if you were lucky), de Zoysa stood for, and died for, his convictions.

Typeset in LaTeX. I wanted to do something fancy with illustrations, but it would've been
overkill as the words stand by themselves.
