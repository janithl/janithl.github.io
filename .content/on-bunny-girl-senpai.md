This weekend, I did something I had never done before: binge an
[entire 13-episode anime][1] AND [its movie][2]. I usually like to
consume media at a much slower pace and sit with what I’ve just
watched in an episode, but two things colluded in this case to make
me buckle my usual habit: my weekdays are packed (making me wait
till next weekend to finish the series), and the story was just so
good that it kept me hooked wanting to see the next episode of the
arc.

This is not meant to be a review. You will find much better-written
reviews by people with far more anime expertise than I do.

Instead, let’s talk about why I related so much with the themes of this
show. I think the overarching theme that ran through many of its arcs
is that we all hold on to bad decisions or unfortunate circumstances
from the past, and it prevents us from moving forward with our lives.

I love the idea of alternate timelines which branch off from the different
decisions that we make. It’s a bit comforting to think that we do have free
will and a world of possibilities exist in front of us. Certainly a far
more uplifting than the idea of fatalism.

This liking of alternate timelines also leads me down endless computational
time spent agonising over what could’ve been. There are a few train-wrecks
that were inevitable, but I still fantasise about ways to have avoided.
There are the people, there are the circumstances, and there’s how you
dealt with them. It’s a never-ending Rubik's cube of possible arrangements
and rearrangements!

So, anyway, my point (if there is any) is that in addition to having anxiety
about your future life and career, you can also have endless fun thinking
about all the ways the past could’ve been different too. Just get creative
with it, and I promise you a never-ending supply of nights where you have
trouble sleeping!
