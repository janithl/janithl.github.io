&lt;p&gt;I've written 18 blog posts in 2019, which is below the target I set at the start
of the year (two blog posts a month, for a total of 24), but it's progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've taken 265 bus rides in 2019, down from 556 in 2018. There is a dramatic
reduction in bus rides after the Easter Attacks in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Bus journeys by month" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/bus-journeys-by-month.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After April, I switched to tuks as my primary mode of commuting to work in the
morning, only taking the bus in the evening during my commute home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While initially driven by post-Easter attack paranoia, environmental factors have
also been a concern especially with the increase in average temperatures. Although
still a firm believer in public transport, I no longer wanted to turn up at work a
sweaty mess. Let's hope A/C buses start rolling out on the 138 route soon&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. 🙏🏽&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other Expenses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've bought food 247 times in 2020, up from 200 times in 2018. The average order
value has gone up slightly, from 572 LKR to 600 LKR. I've bought clothing 4 times,
up from just 2 times in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've made 16 purchases on AliExpress this year, up from 5 purchases last year. The
average order value has stayed roughly the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Social Media&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been on a bit of a hiatus from Twitter and Instagram, with only 6
images posted on my IG this year (and none since June). But I did start
&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/chithrapotha/"&gt;an Instagram purely for my illustrations&lt;/a&gt; and I've managed to post about 29
posts in the space of a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Chithrapotha" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/chithrapotha.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing more and putting it out there is a goal that I want to work towards in
2020. I've also uploaded 18 song snippets to my SoundCloud, and plan to upload
longer and more developed pieces in 2020 (fingers crossed!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="text-center text-muted"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, those are some of my stats for the year. How has 2019 been for you
and how do you plan to spend your 2020?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
window.onload = function() {
   $('table').addClass('table table-bordered table-condensed'); 
}
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still don't have an Uber account, and don't plan on getting one.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And eventually we can all take the Kelani Valley railway, which is
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nuuuwan/status/1203260223378604033"&gt;currently incredibly under-utilised&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="text-center"&gt;Yes, but can Liberals batter down doors anymore?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night, dealing with a bought of insomnia, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/29/lesson-in-boris-johnson-jolliness-liberal-miserabilsm-is-a-turn-off"&gt;I read this important take on BoJo&lt;/a&gt;
(not to be confused with BoJack) and the conservative wave sweeping across not just the
UK but most of the world. While there might be a few points of contention, I think
overall it was a good state of the union on liberalism and what I like to think is a
bit of a disease among educated liberals: the refusal and lack of confidence in pushing
our agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="text-center text-muted"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Born at the tail end of the Berlin Wall and the Soviet Union, my generation was very
liberal and expected the generations that followed us to be even more so. The online
communities where we came of age were incredibly inclusive, liberal, and &lt;em&gt;"woke"&lt;/em&gt;. And
yet, woke culture itself overextended and exposed the flanks, leading to the almost
&lt;em&gt;unthinkable&lt;/em&gt; scenario of an incredibly right-leaning younger generation, and the liberal
and free thinking communities of our youth turned to the right as a reaction to the
seeming &lt;em&gt;authoritarianism of the new left&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;yoofs&lt;/em&gt; were also very much multiculturally aware, having grown up with access to
different &lt;em&gt;lived experiences&lt;/em&gt; via the internet, and very much sensitive to what it saw as
liberal intolerances of differing opinions, as well as seeming mollycoddling of the more
bigoted minorities within minorities. To the kids growing up on Gangam Style, it was no
longer western values at stake but an overarching global value structure&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which was
threatened not by the traditional scapegoat of crusty and rich old conservatives&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but
by increasingly intolerant, tone deaf, preachy ivory tower PC liberals.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="text-center text-muted"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short: Even though there is a lot of hope left in the world and its youth (in
the form of e.g. Greta Thunberg, CAA protestors in Indian universities, and the younger
remain voters at the Brexit polls), it is still disheartening to see some in such an educated
and informed generation turn towards reactionism over progressivism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the libs, it is time to regroup and look inward. We must reflect on the past decade, the
victories (MARRIAGE EQUALITY!) and the bitter defeats, and consider what we value the most,
what our core inviolable principles are. Lines might have to be drawn where our usual support
for personal preferences and freedoms infringe on the rights of the other and the collective&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
It is time to raise those voices in battle cries, as the rich keep becoming richer, and use
their money and influence to sow division among the working man to further their own ends. We
don't have much time—the greed of our race has set the planet on fire. The rich will burrow
underneath and survive, but what of us poor proles? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="text-center text-muted"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is time to step away from books and back into society. It's time to make welfare great again,
fight for unionisation and the rights of the worker and the downtrodden. Come to the understanding
that humanity isn't perfect, but that we must struggle to make this planet and our society better,
more equitable and more inclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's time to bring back civil discourse, please, and thank you. No one likes being talked down to,
or being called racist because they were simply well-meaning but ignorant. Bring back the humanity,

&lt;em&gt;how awesome science is&lt;/em&gt;, and how excited we are about exploring outer space, reforesting our
planet, or curing disease. Stand against bigotry, while also acknowledging that bigotry is bigotry
regardless of the source. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3U6rRK9ul0"&gt;As the great Imtiaz Bakeer Markar once said&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally do not believe it is a zero sum game. Living in a republic is based on a
social contract, and some individualistic excesses might have to be forgone in the service of cohesion.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

So that leaves me at my most comfortable—a good old conversation

&lt;p&gt;There is beauty in solitude. You only truly begin to appreciate it
as you get older. At long last you feel validated that the things
you felt growing up as a shy and introverted only-child have real
world applications!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Society doesn't feel this way about solitude. It sees the uncoupled
male as some sort of threat that has to be neutralised at all cost.
The same relatives who threatened to box your ears if you so much
as looked in the direction of the opposite sex now expect you to bed
a complete stranger. South Asian families are whack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it's just so very amazing to be on your own and really
appreciate it. Like how you appreciate your head ceasing to spin
after a really heavy night of drinking. You just sit there being
thankful for the ordinary, the sober. And that's beautiful, isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;

my first day of digital art!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Second Drawing" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/sketches/digital-2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first few attempts (above) were predictably terrible, but I began realising that my
usual &lt;a href="https://janithl.github.io/2019/11/ive-been-sketching/"&gt;sketching&lt;/a&gt; and watercolouring techniques weren't the best match for the medium,
because digital was something else entirely! As I told Dili, "it's like working with clay,
I can mould this shit all day". And that was my lightbulb moment, the fact that I can
mould the light and shadows to create shapes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's been a lot of fun, and this next piece took only 45 minutes. Having an undo button,
an eraser, and all the brushes in the world&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is definitely expanding the possibilities
for my limited artistic ability. It's like giving FL Studio to a kid who wants to write

&lt;p&gt;Am I a bad person? Was she a bad person? Do we tell each other that
we’re good people to avoid the painful truth that maybe we weren’t
good to each other? That we did things that were downright mean, but
always with the cover of “but I &lt;em&gt;meant&lt;/em&gt; well”.
&lt;em&gt;Cetanaham bhikkhave kammam vadami,&lt;/em&gt; but does the intent lessen the
pain of the person suffering?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="text-center text-muted"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You always seem to attract the destructive type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— a very good friend I haven’t kept in touch with enough&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="text-center text-muted"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People rarely are what they seem on the surface, and that includes yourself.
You know, it doesn’t matter how good your unit test suite is if the train
tracks don’t line up and your integrations fail? It’s the same with people.
No matter how much you think you know yourself, it takes deep, meaningful
and prolonged interaction with another to know what you’re &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="text-center text-muted"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you ever worry that they’ll never appreciate you for who you are? That
you’ll never match up to the version of you in their heads? That they’ll
never know the &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; of your quirks and your ideals, or worse, they’ll
never &lt;em&gt;care&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="text-center text-muted"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sad reality is that [he] has gone head first completely into this.
Willingly. He doesn’t want to get out. He just wants it to conform to his liking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We might see from here that these two aren’t compatible but the fact it until
they decide to let go, we can scream blue murder but it’s not going to do anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[He] has not reached his breaking point. Until then all we can do is commiserate,
love him when he cries, and hope this works out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— a very good friend that I thankfully get to see every week or two&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="text-center text-muted"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Esto Perpetua&lt;/em&gt;. I only got to attend that good school for two years, but the
motto will always stay with me because it spoke to my soul. Be thou forever.
Don’t be afraid to be your own true self, warts and all. Life is too short to
be constantly feel like you’re walking on eggshells, hiding away parts of your
&lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt;, and isolating yourself from the people and activities that meant things
to you. Nothing, and no one, is worth that.&lt;/p&gt;

a member of a minority (and yet, a privileged minority in many ways).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romeo adored Juliet. They had rarely spoken, but he was an ardent
follower of her work since his teens. He was very much smitten, amazed
at how every word she laid down on paper seemed to emanate a softness,
a warmth, a humanity — a deep love and kindness that he saw reflected
in her eyes whenever they rarely did meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in those years of quiet romance from afar, the Capulets went through
their fair share of trials. They were branded traitors to the nation, a
force hell bent on bringing down the Montegues from within. Two-tongued
and devious, driven by a long-term ideology and short-term niceties. A
fifth-column that has waited patiently for centuries for its chance to strike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romeo saw parallels though. He saw the same humanity he saw within his
Montegue friends within Juliet and the dozens of other Capulet friends
he had. He felt that they were all being taken for a ride by those within
the clans that wished for nothing but conflict, for conflict was profitable.
The silent and peaceful (and yet very mistrusting) masses being led for a
ride by those who hogged the limelight, the radicals, the firebrands, the
ones who could easily call for the head of anyone sane who stood up to
them and for common humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t how the future was supposed to look. We were supposed to be the
post-war generation which had learned lessons which were never to be repeated.
We grew up in our multi-cultural schools and with friends from all over. We
had an internet to connect us, Snapchat filters to unite us, a soundtrack of
our youth that we shared with kids from America. Where did it all go so
horribly wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romeo was tired of reality, and very much wished that Juliet was the one
penning the story instead, with that familiar softness, warmth, and humanity
emanating from every word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently read an article about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_determinism"&gt;Hard Determinism&lt;/a&gt;, the theory that there
is no free will, and that given the initial values of things like the physical
constants (the speed of light, the gravitational constant &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt; etc), a universe
would evolve, and of it matter, and of it sentient beings, and of those beings
one would inevitably be sitting in a tuk at a petrol shed typing out these words,
and another would be sitting somewhere reading them just life you. It’s the idea
that everything has been decided ahead of time, and we’re merely playing our parts
in a grand cosmic script over which we have no control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hope that’s &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; the case, and it doesn’t sit well with one of my
(admittedly few) very strongly held beliefs: that each individual, and only s/he,
can determine their reality and the story they write of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, &lt;em&gt;boy oh boy&lt;/em&gt; does it feel like you don’t have a choice sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, personally, the biggest factor keeping me from living life the way I want
to live it is &lt;em&gt;obligations&lt;/em&gt;; I feel very strongly about words I’ve given, or
responsibilities someone has entrusted in me. I go to insane lengths sometimes to
keep my word, putting my own welfare and happiness in jeopardy, and feel intense
guilt when you inevitably fail sometimes to fulfill that obligation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might sound like a innocuous enough problem to have, but it isn’t. I often end
up in situations which range from the awkward to the borderline hazardous because I
don’t set realistic expectations, set boundaries, or don’t say no enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post has no grand message, but I’ve had a shitty month so far, and:&lt;br&gt;
a) &lt;a href="https://alifeofsaturdays.wordpress.com/2019/01/27/reasons-not-to-write/"&gt;Adilah’s lovely post about excuses not to write&lt;/a&gt;, and&lt;br&gt;
b) &lt;a href="https://thamara.blog/expectations-97685dd85811"&gt;Thamara’s about managing expectations&lt;/a&gt;, made me just want to get this out of my system. 🤷&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These were the heady days of youthful exuberance, when any idea seemed
like it was worth pursuing — all the world’s problems could be solved
with code, y’know? — and the internet was new, exciting, and as yet
relatively uncommercialised. I was going through a major Britpop phase
and this anthem seemed to best capture the spirit of the age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i_2mWhfOhGU"

&lt;p class="text-center"&gt;My favourite member of the band was obviously Guigsy, the bassist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you’re the same as me&lt;br&gt;
We see things they’ll never see&lt;br&gt;
You and I are gonna live forever&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were no limits back then, no wary old voice at the back of your
head saying &lt;em&gt;“someone must’ve written a library for this before”&lt;/em&gt;, or
&lt;em&gt;“if this is worth anything Google would’ve done it already”.&lt;/em&gt; Bus route
finders and blog aggregators just sprung up, with hopelessly naive yet
somehow (barely) functioning code that got the job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2012: A Certain Romance — Arctic Monkeys&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My final year of uni was happening, and there was a real chance of me failing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, this might’ve been an overreaction to the statement by a
lecturer that last year’s batch had done awfully, and half had flunked their
finals. But I was fed up of the years of uni I’d already been through, and
wanted to finally be a salaryman. No chances were hence taken, and no quarter
given. From the end of the day’s lecturers right up until 8 PM when the library
closed down, I would be in there studying. Every. Single. Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were some perks. Pretty librarians, and even prettier girls. Nothing
(obviously) came of it, but I got introduced to a lot of good music: Hendrix,
Clapton, and the Monkeys from Sheffield. I still consider their debut album
— chronicling a night out clubbing— one of the finest ever crafted. Alex Turner
was barely 20 at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="700" height="393" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RyEiRKJJr6A"
frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p class="text-center"&gt;Alex ❤&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well over there, there’s friends of mine&lt;br&gt;
What can I say? I’ve known ’em for a long long time&lt;br&gt;
And yeah they might overstep the line&lt;br&gt;
But I just cannot get angry in the same way&lt;br&gt;
Not in the same way&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I passed. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2017: Don’t Stop — Fleetwood Mac&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was it even a &lt;strong&gt;break up&lt;/strong&gt; if you didn’t listen to &lt;strong&gt;Rumours&lt;/strong&gt;
by &lt;strong&gt;Fleetwood Mac&lt;/strong&gt; at least 6 times?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was trudging through my second job like a British tax inspector through a cold
thunderstorm. The project I was working through had been through 6 weeks of hell
and back — all to deliver a product that would’ve taken &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; number of weeks in
&lt;em&gt;half the time&lt;/em&gt;, all because it had been sold to the client as something that
could be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone involved in that sales pitch had disappeared, and a team of mostly
greenhorns had to spend late nights and weekends, clocking up 100-hour weeks for
this impossible goal. There was a week where I had spent 6 midnights in a row at
the office. We’d go home at 2 AM (on a good day) and be back at work at 9 AM for
the morning client call with the team in Brisbane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As 2017 ended, and I spent Christmas ‘holidays’ in an empty office working, my
mind was set on quitting as soon as possible. The only thing keeping me going
were the breakup songs playing through my tinny headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="700" height="393" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QV9JJmSCiI8"
frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p class="text-center"&gt;Everyone needs some of that coke in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wake up and don’t want to smile&lt;br&gt;
If it takes just a little while&lt;br&gt;
Open your eyes and look at the day&lt;br&gt;
You’ll see things in a different way&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t stop thinking about tomorrow&lt;br&gt;
Don’t stop, it’ll soon be here&lt;br&gt;
It’ll be, better than before&lt;br&gt;
Yesterday’s gone, yesterday’s gone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2018: Renu Renu — Rookantha Gunathilake&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2018 was an year of catharsis in many ways. I was able to leave my second job
and transition to my third, work with a group of people whom I enjoy being
around, and work at my own pace. I listen to a lot of Rookantha and &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/tags/synthwave"&gt;Synthwave&lt;/a&gt;
these days, when I need to get deep work done and block out the distractions of the
co-working space we operate out of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Renu Renu&lt;/em&gt; is the 7th track from Roo’s seminal 1988 release &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/lk/album/bambara-pahasa/1440268046"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bambara Pahasa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
With such evergreen hits like the title track, the patriotic anthem &lt;em&gt;Indunil Gangulel&lt;/em&gt;,
&lt;em&gt;Sithin Sina Sisi&lt;/em&gt; (one of my favourite love songs ever), &lt;em&gt;Anatha Maruthe&lt;/em&gt;,
&lt;em&gt;Suwanda Dena Mal Wane&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lande Mula Wee&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Bambara Pahasa&lt;/em&gt; cassette (which I
grew up listening to) marked a high point in the Sri Lankan popular music industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One year later, its greatest ever songwriter Premakeerthi de Alwis was killed in the
midst of an extremely gruesome war between Marxist insurgents and government death squads
that were ready to match and amplify the savagery, marking the start of a slow but steady
decline in both the commercial reach and the artistic achievements of the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the work itself — it isn’t the most exciting in the world. I’m no longer working
with the latest cutting-edge tech and writing code in a language that came out 6 months
ago and Babel transpiles into 16 different varieties of Javascript, but sometimes
&lt;em&gt;boring is good&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This beautiful track is like 3-songs-in-one. Also, Rupavahini should bring back
Saxophonists in naval suits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;රේණු රේණු මල් මිටේ රේණු&lt;br&gt;
ඈට පෙම් කරන්න මට බෑලු&lt;br&gt;
රන් සමනල තටු මට ලැබෙන්නෙ නෑලු&lt;br&gt;
රොන් පිරී සැලෙන්න මල් රේණු&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;සඳවත දෝ මා දුටුවේ&lt;br&gt;
ඔබෙ ගත දෝ මා දුටුවේ&lt;br&gt;
සිතුවම් දෝ මා දුටුවේ&lt;br&gt;
හැබැහින් දෝ ඔබ දුටුවේ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally left my job of a few months over four years and am currently in the twilight
zone (?) or whatever they call it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also did something very uncharacteristic and went out and bought myself something, a
budget Stratocaster. I don't really play the guitar enough to justify this, and fully 
blame Rob Chapman and Lee Anderton for making me do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The Strat" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/the-strat.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; going through a full-on midlife crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also started binging BoJack Horseman, which has gems like these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, sometimes I feel like I was born with a leak, and any goodness I started with
just slowly spilled out of me, and now it's all gone. And I'll never get it back in me.
It's too late. Life is a series of closing doors, isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not the greatest show to be watching if you're ever in that place where you're not really
sure if you're a good person, and nothing new is happening and you feel like you're
coasting on &lt;em&gt;that one time&lt;/em&gt; you did well (a long long time ago...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anywayyy, this wasn't supposed to be &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; negative (you should've seen the first draft)
so we'll wind up here.

I got a lot of time to sit down and reflect, and I grow thankful every day for
the people who choose to stand by me despite all my shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of 2016, let me turn the things that made me happy this year into
a Top 5 list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;1. I got to travel&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since "the incident" of Feb 2014, I've not really travelled as much as I
would've normally liked to. This year though began with some travel: to
Pasikuda with the family. Places I got to travel to this year includes that
and our usual annual trips to Kandy, Anuradhapura (and Yapahuwa, a first for 
me), &lt;a href="https://janithl.github.io/2016/09/somawathiya-september-2016/"&gt;Somawathiya&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Deep South&lt;/em&gt; (Katharagama, Mulkirigala etc.) and 
some really fun day trips Down South with the co-workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Deep South Instagrams" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/deep-south.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was particularly happy with the pics I got to take on the Deep South trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;2. I got to learn&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... both in and out of the classroom. In the classroom I tried to wrap my head
around ML techniques, &lt;a href="https://janithl.github.io/2016/08/and-so-it-began/"&gt;neural nets&lt;/a&gt;, advanced DBs and their ilk. Outside
of it, I got to play with React quite a bit, learn &lt;a href="https://laravel.com/"&gt;Laravel&lt;/a&gt; in a (cramped)
couple of months and push out live systems almost immediately (what a beautiful
framework, has changed the way I write PHP for the better). I got to dabble in
more Python than I ever got to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got into &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzZCiVjRPPDCpP5l7HIGRtA"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3Wj9aO8VS5ZuXrtWfJf81w"&gt;crazy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCOIcdii1bQmfSPHeNNw4Qw"&gt;YouTube channels&lt;/a&gt; that inspired me to pick 
up my guitar after years, adjust the truss rod and play some barre chords. I
followed Casey Neistat as he built and sold a company, and let John Green
teach me history like I was taking my AP exams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;3. I got time off&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got three months off to write my thesis' lit review, write this blog, &lt;a href="https://janithl.github.io/2016/09/the-unp-at-70/"&gt;write 
about the UNP&lt;/a&gt; and write code to buff up my Github profile. I started working
at YAMU the week after I was done with my final exam at uni, and I never got a 
proper break since. Those 3 months let me put everything in perspective and 
helped me decide what I really wanted to do with my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;4. I got bald&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, started balding. Not really fussed about it. (I feel that) I am well aware 
of my mortality, and that I'm no longer the youngest guy in the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;5. I got to let go&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... of some important things which I once thought would stay with me for (most
of my) life. It was much easier than I thought and I feel much better for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is a stream and hanging on to a bank is not going to help when eventually
we all need to float away. Or so I feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Facebook Year in Review" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/fb-2016.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that's been my year. It wasn't terrible personally by a long stretch, but
it was certainly challenging and 2017 promises to be even more so. I hope you've
all had a good year, and wish you all the best for the next one.

&lt;p&gt;The wisest programmer I've ever met once said that software development 
at scale is all about &lt;em&gt;"letting go"&lt;/em&gt;. I won't say I'm anywhere near 
that level of Zen, but I'm certainly much less OCD about the giant fire 
in the room. It's a pointless to make reversing entropy your life's work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has proven to be much more difficult than I imagined, not because I don't
have fictional characters that I can relate to, but because...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, see, this is the thing. There are parts of yourself, character traits, 
that you like to think define you. These are all great and noble things, the 
Gryffindor of character traits, all golden and perfect. The naked truth,
though, is that that's what you &lt;em&gt;want to be&lt;/em&gt;, not really who you are in reality. 
When you do, in the sober light of day, do an honest assessment of things, you 
do fall desperately short in quite a few departments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhoo, after days of thinking about this, I finally got my three:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Harrymort, &lt;a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seventh Horcrux&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear god, I really wanted to write about how much I &lt;strong&gt;absolutely LOVED&lt;/strong&gt; this 
fanfic. And I &lt;em&gt;despise&lt;/em&gt; fanfics as a rule. But please, guys, do yourselves a 
favour: get off that Pottermore trash and read &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;. Pliss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Harrymort" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/harrymort.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Harrymort is brilliant (and described by the author as "a series of bad 
decisions executed well"). He is remorseless and persistent, and did I mention 
brilliant? These are all character traits I tend to fanboy over, being so 
intelligent that even when you mess up, you've done such a good job of it that 
your failures are just as spectacular as when you win. They don't really 
describe me though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Evanesco troll," I murmured. The troll disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hero worship filled my minion's Weasley eyes. "Wicked."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hermione asked, "Where did it go?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shrugged. "Where does anything that's vanished go?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stood there for a few minutes, contemplating the nature of nonexistence. At 
least that's what I was doing. I don't know about the children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, shortly after we all should have died horrible deaths via bludgeoning, 
the professors arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I do relate to a lot is his constant paranoia, and seeing conspiracies and 
intrigue everywhere (because if you're doing it, everyone else must be too, 
right?). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrymort is so wrapped up in his lies that he starts to believe them, like his
absolute assertion that Hermione is a dark witch, Ron's a werewolf, and that
Muggle-born wizards and witches have been left behind by their magical parents 
with Muggles acting as childcare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I absolutely adore him. GO READ, NOW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Mark Brendanawicz, &lt;em&gt;Parks and Rec&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Parks and Rec" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/parks-and-rec.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Brendanawicz? More like Brendana-Quits!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why a character from the shows difficult beginnings? Why a really bland and 
unlovable character who didn't make an impact from a show full of strong and 
lovable characters?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After years of his life wasted in the city planning (a subject I deeply love) 
department, he finally quit to go work in the private sector. He makes silly 
decisions (Ann), breaks his legs, almost humiliates himself with by proposing 
to a woman who's about to break up with him, and leaves behind the people he
&lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; loved (Leslie). Despite all the crashing and burning, he was perhaps
one of the most realistic characters in a show full of superhumans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They even threw out his plans for the park and got someone from Eagleton (!!) 
to redraw the thing. Such is life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Max Fischer, &lt;em&gt;Rushmore&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Max Fischer" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/max-rosemary.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, just like Max, like to think of myself as a grown-up and an intellectual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I, just like Max, am nothing of the sort. When you finally do meet an actual 
adult (like Rosemary - who Max sees as an &lt;em&gt;equal&lt;/em&gt; and a potential partner), your 
embarrassing childishness shows, you are incapable of processing how to handle 
a real relationship, and your Latin is terrible (or rather, &lt;em&gt;nonexistent&lt;/em&gt;, 
because you foolishly tried to get rid of it from the curriculum).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, you and Herman deserve each other. You're both little children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we've all been Max at a point in our lives. When we realize that even at 
our best, we're still not &lt;em&gt;good enough&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="people"></category><category term="films"></category><category term="wes anderson"></category></entry><entry><title>When You Say Nothing At All</title><link href="https://janithl.github.io/2016/09/when-you-say-nothing-at-all/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-09-15T06:28:00+05:30</published><updated>2016-09-15T06:28:00+05:30</updated><author><name>Janith</name></author><id>tag:janithl.github.io,2016-09-15:/2016/09/when-you-say-nothing-at-all/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Comic" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/wysnaa-comic.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
