post-attempted coup in Turkey, instead of having a half-dozen 
status updates with cryptic captions that, when analysed together,
gives someone an idea of where I stand on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/07/18/turkey-and-nato-what-comes-next-is-messy-coup-erdogan-incirlik-air-base-nuclear-weapons/"&gt;Writing for Foreign Policy&lt;/a&gt;, 
retired American 4-star admiral and supreme NATO commander James 
Stavridis says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highly unstable geopolitics of the Levant and NATO’s 
expanding security needs come together at a crossroads in Turkey. 
It is not only a nation, but a civilization as well, one that has 
an acute sense of its importance and history in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ottoman Empire came to an end after the Great War, and the 
Turkish republic rose from its ashes - led by a man whose legacy 
has played a significant part of its landscape since: Mustafa Kemal 
Ataturk. Ataturk came to power in a defeated nation that was about 
to be partitioned among foreign powers, and led it on a path of 
modernisation that made it an important regional power and 
(long after his death) an important NATO member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is Ataturk's policies of secularism and democracy that the 
&lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-purge-begins-in-turkey"&gt;Turkish Army vows to uphold whenever it takes power&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the Turkish republic was founded, in 1923, the county’s 
generals have imagined themselves the ultimate arbiters of its 
politics, stepping into power—sometimes savagely—whenever they 
felt the government had become either too leftist or too Islamic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it succeeds or fails in this endeavour depends on who you're 
asking. For example, the biography of 1980s coup leader 
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenan_Evren"&gt;Kenan Evren&lt;/a&gt; reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He professed great admiration for the founder of the Republic of 
Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk; however, he shut down many institutions 
founded by Atatürk and is often accused of deforming the country's 
legal system against Atatürk's principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Erdogan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recep Tayyip Erdogan was elected PM in 2003. His Justice and 
Development Party (AKP) embodies liberal economics and conservative 
social values. He was mayor of Istanbul (1994 - 1998) running on an 
Islamist platform, but was stripped of his office and imprisoned for 
"incitement to violence and religious or racial hatred". When he became 
PM in 2003, he was &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-purge-begins-in-turkey"&gt;hailed as some Islamist democrat messiah&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Erdoğan first became Prime Minister, in 2003, he was the Islamic world’s
great democratic hope, a leader of enormous vitality who would show the world
that an avowedly Islamist politician could lead a stable democracy and carry on
as a member of NATO, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erdogan's &lt;em&gt;"Neo-Ottomanism"&lt;/em&gt; and other policies are a fascinating discussion 
in and of themselves, but I'll leave those out of this post. What we need 
to understand though is that Erdogan does not trust the military to not 
topple him, which led in the late 2000s to a series of investigations and
trials pertaining to an alleged coup plan called "Operation Sledgehammer". 
From the earlier FP article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of senior admirals and generals were charged and jailed on suspect
charges in the so-called Sledgehammer scandals of the 2000s, and the seeds of
the current coup were planted when bitter military leaders watched their
commanders and mentors be taken to prison in handcuffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the evidence was &lt;a href="http://rodrik.typepad.com/dani_rodriks_weblog/2012/10/did-microsoft-steal-its-fonts-from-the-turkish-army.html"&gt;flimsy at best&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these documents carry last-saved dates from 2002-2003, appear to have 
been authored by officers on duty at the time, and were burned on CDs that 
were apparently finalized in March 2003.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet when forensic experts looked more closely at the document with a Hex 
editor, which shows all the binary information on the file, they made a 
discovery that revealed that the metadata had been tampered with.  In plain 
sight on the raw file was a reference to “Calibri,” a font that Microsoft 
introduced with Office 2007 as the new default font for Word, and was first 
released to the public in mid-2006.  The only explanation for this anachronistic 
reference was that the file had been worked on with Office 2007 before it was 
ultimately saved in an earlier version of Word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of the coup attempt last week, there'll no doubt be more 
generals dragged away in chains, and more institutions falling under Erdogan's 
command in his mad rush for dictatorial powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this could lead to rocky times for NATO ahead. Of particular concern are 
the &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-h-bombs-in-turkey"&gt;nuclear weapons stored at Incirlik&lt;/a&gt;, 
70 miles from the Syrian border:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security concerns at Incirlik Airbase recently prompted a major upgrade of 
the perimeter fence that surrounds its nuclear-weapons storage area. Incirlik 
is about seventy miles from the Syrian border, and since last October American
aircraft and drones based there have been attacking ISIS forces. Its proximity
to rebel-controlled areas in Syria and the rash of terrorist acts in Turkey led
the Pentagon, a few months ago, to issue an “ordered departure” of all the
family members of American troops at Incirlik.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post came out shorter than expected, because I skipped the bit I really 
wanted to talk about - Erdogan and his politics. I'll hopefully have time 
&lt;em&gt;(lol)&lt;/em&gt; to write in more depth about what the last 13 years have looked like 
for Turkey under Erdogan, and what his potential endgame might be - for both 
Turkey and the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="geopolitics"></category></entry><entry><title>Where The Lovers Have No Name</title><link href="https://janithl.github.io/2016/07/where-the-lovers-have-no-name/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-07-18T11:06:00+05:30</published><author><name>Janith</name></author><id>tag:janithl.github.io,2016-07-18:2016/07/where-the-lovers-have-no-name/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Camouflaged Love by Prasad Aluthwattha" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/best-art-ever.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This probably pisses off so many radicals on all sides of Sri Lankan  society,
with their (very similar) views on sexuality and propriety. "Hoo!", I say  to
them, "Hoo!".

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Silent tears full of pride&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In a world made of steel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Made of stone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturdays are spent at uni, and whenever I'm at uni I think of a 
&lt;a href="https://janithl.github.io/2016/07/shes-wot-m8.html"&gt;particular person&lt;/a&gt; who 
has nothing whatsoever to even do with uni. At one critical 3 hour paper last
semester, I spent maybe  one and a half hours desperately stuck in an alternate
reality in which we were more than just casual acquaintances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uni takes a heavy toll on my brain as well. Just today, within a couple of
minutes of each other, I had to  grapple with Hopfield Nets, Boltzmann Machines
(and energy functions and my old friend - Bayes' theorem), Convolutional Neural
Networks and their various stages of convolution and max pooling, and - in a 
totally unrelated class - flow networks, max-flow min-cut, to graph colouring 
and its many fascinating applications (all the way from scheduling to Sudoku). 
The only prior exposure I had to any of this was knowing that 4 colours are 
enough to colour any map, because I'm a &lt;em&gt;cartonerd&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, geekery isn't the only reason I &lt;em&gt;enjoy&lt;/em&gt; Saturdays. I get to speak to 3 
peers (who are older and wiser, so not really peers) who give me a fresh 
perspective on a lot of things. This week's installment was on dealing with 
bosses and criticism, and how you need to put your head down and accept things 
as they are and not pick fights. I listened, and pondered, but I don't really 
agree - being the socialist and troublemaker that I am. I think bosses need to 
be smarter at this whole game (and more diplomatic) than their charges, and 
maybe get rid of the whole boss/employee thing altogether and see each other 
as partners (like &lt;em&gt;that'll&lt;/em&gt; ever happen in our deeply hierarchical society).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, an observation my aforementioned peers made a few weeks ago, and I can 
anecdotally confirm because a lot of my batch-mates who graduated with me ended 
up so, is that a significant segment of female Sri Lankan graduates never work
in that field - or work at all. Even in a highly lucrative area like Software
Engineering. They end up married, and apparently that piece of paper is a 
prerequisite. IDK. So the next time someone asks you why there are so few 
female programmers...&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="uni"></category></entry><entry><title>Drift</title><link href="https://janithl.github.io/2016/07/drift/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-07-15T21:33:00+05:30</published><author><name>Janith</name></author><id>tag:janithl.github.io,2016-07-15:2016/07/drift/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Though I know I'll never lose affection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For people and things that went before&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drift is only natural in human relationships, and you shouldn't really feel bad
about the inevitable. People change, relationships change, you meet new people,
you  move to greener pastures. It's perfectly normal to be mobile in a modern
society. I mean, what  are we? Serfs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are people I used to spend hours with, at school, online, people with whom
I shared my life and my secrets. And whose secrets I kept. And all these years
later  we barely even keep in touch, which is normal, which is &lt;em&gt;fine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if only there was a way to get rid of this pesky little thing called guilt.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="people"></category></entry><entry><title>Breathing</title><link href="https://janithl.github.io/2016/07/breathing/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-07-15T14:15:00+05:30</published><author><name>Janith</name></author><id>tag:janithl.github.io,2016-07-15:2016/07/breathing/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;'Cause I am hanging on every word you say&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That's alright, alright with me...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's been a bit of an off-day. In the last few days I've a couple of 
interesting Medium posts. Highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A healthy product company is, confusingly, one at odds with itself. 
There is a healthy part which is attempting to normalize and to create 
predictability, and there needs to be another part that is tasked with 
building something new that is going to disrupt and eventually destroy 
that normality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failure to create some form of predictability will result in chaos. 
Failure to create some well-maintained Barbaric chaos inside the company 
guarantees that a fast-moving, ambitious, risk-taking and ruthless someone 
else — someone outside the company will invade because they know what you 
forgot: hacking is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@rands/hacking-is-important-ea632819d87c#.5sr0fxo71"&gt;'Hacking is Important'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve recently moved to a more “hip” location. We used to have personal 
desks, but now we have this “pick whatever spot is avaiable” open area. I 
dislike it a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@Svenskunganka/interviewing-my-mother-a-mainframe-cobol-programmer-c693d40d88f7#.7sslqjnn1"&gt;'Interviewing my mother, a mainframe COBOL programmer'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Progress has been slow on the research papers I'm supposed to be reading, so 
I picked up watching (the 7th season, which I've missed so far, of) Archer 
instead. I will attempt, today, to print some slides and prepare for the 
lectures I have tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I inadvertently opined on some work-related matters (&lt;em&gt;bad me&lt;/em&gt;) because I ran 
into my co-workers yesterday and we engaged in a bit of shop-talk. Whoops. I
just pointed at an &lt;a href="https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html"&gt;old standard&lt;/a&gt; 
that I live by and hoped that it wasn't too intrusive of me to get involved. 
Again, &lt;em&gt;bad me&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Mal B'day" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/mal-bday.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the reason we all met was: &lt;strong&gt;MALINTHE TURNED 26!&lt;/strong&gt; We're all getting 
really old now, eh? The thing was excellent, though Whight's other patrons 
might've not defined it as such, due to how &lt;em&gt;quiet&lt;/em&gt; our table was. Yes, 
we're always &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; people when we're together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That concludes my useless update for the day, stay tuned for more daily tripe.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="work"></category><category term="uni"></category></entry><entry><title>She's Wot M8?</title><link href="https://janithl.github.io/2016/07/shes-wot-m8/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-07-14T11:07:00+05:30</published><author><name>Janith</name></author><id>tag:janithl.github.io,2016-07-14:2016/07/shes-wot-m8/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why her though?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She's...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not your type? At all?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; my type, again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not her&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Come on, dude. I've known you since we had other people wash our bums for us.
She's so not your type&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, we're grown-ups now. Shouldn't we look past "types" and all those
primitive constructs. I like her for who she is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Or you like her who who she makes you...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh, you know. Saves you from your eternal fear of ending up with a... simpleton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Look, you barely know her. In the past few days, from what I've seen, you've
been using that blank canvas to project your hopes and dreams&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dude. Too much truth on a Monday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;She's your ticket to legitimacy, the girl who reads, and knows, and speaks
well. She's funny, and beautiful, and you know she's going to be on the top of
the world one day. The ultimate Manic Pixie Dream Girl for nerds who actually
want them to be a bit less dreamy and a bit less manic...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I ain't sayin' I'm a gold digger, but I ain't messin' with no...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Look, all I'm saying is that she deserves better than to be blank canvas, or a 
trophy, no? She deserves to be her own woman, and you need to start seeing any 
person you'll be with as an equal, not as a stepping stone for your own...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zip it, Sherlock. I think they've all stopped reading at this point...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ah, it seems so.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="conversations"></category></entry><entry><title>Status Update</title><link href="https://janithl.github.io/2016/07/status-update/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-07-13T20:56:00+05:30</published><author><name>Janith</name></author><id>tag:janithl.github.io,2016-07-13:2016/07/status-update/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was watching &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlJnsHpWamU"&gt;one of the talks Casey Neistat gave at
Vidcon&lt;/a&gt; this year, and he talks
about his love for the 'act of creation', and how he loves his job just like  he
loves his family. The drive he has to wake up early to edit a video and put it
out, 365 days a year. It's crazy, and it makes me wish I had the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look, time for some straight talk, which I'm going to go into here because
nobody probably reads this (or knows it even exists). This &lt;em&gt;'sabbatical'&lt;/em&gt; was
going to be me getting down and slogging through a really difficult thesis, in
an area I barely understand (Natural Language Processing, Topic Detection and
Tracking, Temporal Text Mining etc.), and maybe rediscovering the spark, the
excitement that made me want to be a programmer all those years, and which
(along with a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_2mWhfOhGU"&gt;swelling Oasis
soundtrack&lt;/a&gt;) drove me to create
some really cool side-projects while at uni that ultimately landed me the sweet
gig of being a developer at my current place of employment. And three days in, I
can tell you that motivation is running real low and a huge part of me wants to
step back from the challenge and go back to the mundane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Masters', which I started in Jan 2015, has been harder on me than anything
I've done before. Before, when I was in school or uni, I had 7 days a week and
all of my mindspace to understand what I was being taught and properly digest
it. Contrary to what people expect from me, I'm not a fast learner. I'm slow and
take my time to experiment and truly grasp a concept, before becoming so
familiar and comfortable with it that I can run circles around everyone else
with my newfound toy. Getting thrown toys (and frankly amazing ones at that,
like R or NLTK) and having to balance them with the mundane work I do 9 - 5 on
weekdays has been like missing a WT20 finals because you need to water the
plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that's the situation as of now. The only driving force I have is this absurd
belief that, since I've finished everything I've &lt;em&gt;'passed'&lt;/em&gt; everything I've
started before, it'll be the same this time around as well. Let's hope lightning
does strike the same place repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="uni"></category><category term="oasis"></category><category term="work"></category></entry><entry><title>July</title><link href="https://janithl.github.io/2016/07/july/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-07-12T23:57:00+05:30</published><author><name>Janith</name></author><id>tag:janithl.github.io,2016-07-12:2016/07/july/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's July, I'm on a twelve week break from &lt;em&gt;jeewanopaya&lt;/em&gt;, it's
