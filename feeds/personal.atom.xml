&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t go away. None of it does. No matter how kind or forgiving
you are, the stains of the &lt;em&gt;‘bad times’&lt;/em&gt; stay on like fountain pen
ink on white fabric, refusing to budge. All they need is some mild
reoccurrence to go full-on #ThrowbackThursday&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="text-center text-muted"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I a bad person? Was she a bad person? Do we tell each other that
we’re good people to avoid the painful truth that maybe we weren’t
good to each other? That we did things that were downright mean, but
always with the cover of “but I &lt;em&gt;meant&lt;/em&gt; well”.
&lt;em&gt;Cetanaham bhikkhave kammam vadami,&lt;/em&gt; but does the intent lessen the
pain of the person suffering?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="text-center text-muted"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You always seem to attract the destructive type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— a very good friend I haven’t kept in touch with enough&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="text-center text-muted"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People rarely are what they seem on the surface, and that includes yourself.
You know, it doesn’t matter how good your unit test suite is if the train
tracks don’t line up and your integrations fail? It’s the same with people.
No matter how much you think you know yourself, it takes deep, meaningful
and prolonged interaction with another to know what you’re &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="text-center text-muted"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you ever worry that they’ll never appreciate you for who you are? That
you’ll never match up to the version of you in their heads? That they’ll
never know the &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; of your quirks and your ideals, or worse, they’ll
never &lt;em&gt;care&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="text-center text-muted"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sad reality is that [he] has gone head first completely into this.
Willingly. He doesn’t want to get out. He just wants it to conform to his liking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We might see from here that these two aren’t compatible but the fact it until
they decide to let go, we can scream blue murder but it’s not going to do anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[He] has not reached his breaking point. Until then all we can do is commiserate,
love him when he cries, and hope this works out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— a very good friend that I thankfully get to see every week or two&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="text-center text-muted"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Esto Perpetua&lt;/em&gt;. I only got to attend that good school for two years, but the
motto will always stay with me because it spoke to my soul. Be thou forever.
Don’t be afraid to be your own true self, warts and all. Life is too short to
be constantly feel like you’re walking on eggshells, hiding away parts of your
&lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt;, and isolating yourself from the people and activities that meant things
to you. Nothing, and no one, is worth that.&lt;/p&gt;

a member of a minority (and yet, a privileged minority in many ways).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romeo adored Juliet. They had rarely spoken, but he was an ardent
follower of her work since his teens. He was very much smitten, amazed
at how every word she laid down on paper seemed to emanate a softness,
a warmth, a humanity — a deep love and kindness that he saw reflected
in her eyes whenever they rarely did meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in those years of quiet romance from afar, the Capulets went through
their fair share of trials. They were branded traitors to the nation, a
force hell bent on bringing down the Montegues from within. Two-tongued
and devious, driven by a long-term ideology and short-term niceties. A
fifth-column that has waited patiently for centuries for its chance to strike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romeo saw parallels though. He saw the same humanity he saw within his
Montegue friends within Juliet and the dozens of other Capulet friends
he had. He felt that they were all being taken for a ride by those within
the clans that wished for nothing but conflict, for conflict was profitable.
The silent and peaceful (and yet very mistrusting) masses being led for a
ride by those who hogged the limelight, the radicals, the firebrands, the
ones who could easily call for the head of anyone sane who stood up to
them and for common humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t how the future was supposed to look. We were supposed to be the
post-war generation which had learned lessons which were never to be repeated.
We grew up in our multi-cultural schools and with friends from all over. We
had an internet to connect us, Snapchat filters to unite us, a soundtrack of
our youth that we shared with kids from America. Where did it all go so
horribly wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romeo was tired of reality, and very much wished that Juliet was the one
penning the story instead, with that familiar softness, warmth, and humanity
emanating from every word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently read an article about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_determinism"&gt;Hard Determinism&lt;/a&gt;, the theory that there
is no free will, and that given the initial values of things like the physical
constants (the speed of light, the gravitational constant &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt; etc), a universe
would evolve, and of it matter, and of it sentient beings, and of those beings
one would inevitably be sitting in a tuk at a petrol shed typing out these words,
and another would be sitting somewhere reading them just life you. It’s the idea
that everything has been decided ahead of time, and we’re merely playing our parts
in a grand cosmic script over which we have no control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hope that’s &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; the case, and it doesn’t sit well with one of my
(admittedly few) very strongly held beliefs: that each individual, and only s/he,
can determine their reality and the story they write of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, &lt;em&gt;boy oh boy&lt;/em&gt; does it feel like you don’t have a choice sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, personally, the biggest factor keeping me from living life the way I want
to live it is &lt;em&gt;obligations&lt;/em&gt;; I feel very strongly about words I’ve given, or
responsibilities someone has entrusted in me. I go to insane lengths sometimes to
keep my word, putting my own welfare and happiness in jeopardy, and feel intense
guilt when you inevitably fail sometimes to fulfill that obligation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might sound like a innocuous enough problem to have, but it isn’t. I often end
up in situations which range from the awkward to the borderline hazardous because I
don’t set realistic expectations, set boundaries, or don’t say no enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post has no grand message, but I’ve had a shitty month so far, and:&lt;br&gt;
a) &lt;a href="https://alifeofsaturdays.wordpress.com/2019/01/27/reasons-not-to-write/"&gt;Adilah’s lovely post about excuses not to write&lt;/a&gt;, and&lt;br&gt;
b) &lt;a href="https://thamara.blog/expectations-97685dd85811"&gt;Thamara’s about managing expectations&lt;/a&gt;, made me just want to get this out of my system. 🤷&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These were the heady days of youthful exuberance, when any idea seemed
like it was worth pursuing — all the world’s problems could be solved
with code, y’know? — and the internet was new, exciting, and as yet
relatively uncommercialised. I was going through a major Britpop phase
and this anthem seemed to best capture the spirit of the age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i_2mWhfOhGU"
frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p class="text-center"&gt;My favourite member of the band was obviously Guigsy, the bassist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you’re the same as me&lt;br&gt;
We see things they’ll never see&lt;br&gt;
You and I are gonna live forever&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were no limits back then, no wary old voice at the back of your
head saying &lt;em&gt;“someone must’ve written a library for this before”&lt;/em&gt;, or
&lt;em&gt;“if this is worth anything Google would’ve done it already”.&lt;/em&gt; Bus route
finders and blog aggregators just sprung up, with hopelessly naive yet
somehow (barely) functioning code that got the job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2012: A Certain Romance — Arctic Monkeys&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My final year of uni was happening, and there was a real chance of me failing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, this might’ve been an overreaction to the statement by a
lecturer that last year’s batch had done awfully, and half had flunked their
finals. But I was fed up of the years of uni I’d already been through, and
wanted to finally be a salaryman. No chances were hence taken, and no quarter
given. From the end of the day’s lecturers right up until 8 PM when the library
closed down, I would be in there studying. Every. Single. Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were some perks. Pretty librarians, and even prettier girls. Nothing
(obviously) came of it, but I got introduced to a lot of good music: Hendrix,
Clapton, and the Monkeys from Sheffield. I still consider their debut album
— chronicling a night out clubbing— one of the finest ever crafted. Alex Turner
was barely 20 at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="700" height="393" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RyEiRKJJr6A"

&lt;p class="text-center"&gt;Alex ❤&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well over there, there’s friends of mine&lt;br&gt;
What can I say? I’ve known ’em for a long long time&lt;br&gt;
And yeah they might overstep the line&lt;br&gt;
But I just cannot get angry in the same way&lt;br&gt;
Not in the same way&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I passed. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2017: Don’t Stop — Fleetwood Mac&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was it even a &lt;strong&gt;break up&lt;/strong&gt; if you didn’t listen to &lt;strong&gt;Rumours&lt;/strong&gt;
by &lt;strong&gt;Fleetwood Mac&lt;/strong&gt; at least 6 times?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was trudging through my second job like a British tax inspector through a cold
thunderstorm. The project I was working through had been through 6 weeks of hell
and back — all to deliver a product that would’ve taken &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; number of weeks in
&lt;em&gt;half the time&lt;/em&gt;, all because it had been sold to the client as something that
could be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone involved in that sales pitch had disappeared, and a team of mostly
greenhorns had to spend late nights and weekends, clocking up 100-hour weeks for
this impossible goal. There was a week where I had spent 6 midnights in a row at
the office. We’d go home at 2 AM (on a good day) and be back at work at 9 AM for
the morning client call with the team in Brisbane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As 2017 ended, and I spent Christmas ‘holidays’ in an empty office working, my
mind was set on quitting as soon as possible. The only thing keeping me going
were the breakup songs playing through my tinny headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="700" height="393" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QV9JJmSCiI8"

&lt;p class="text-center"&gt;Everyone needs some of that coke in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wake up and don’t want to smile&lt;br&gt;
If it takes just a little while&lt;br&gt;
Open your eyes and look at the day&lt;br&gt;
You’ll see things in a different way&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t stop thinking about tomorrow&lt;br&gt;
Don’t stop, it’ll soon be here&lt;br&gt;
It’ll be, better than before&lt;br&gt;
Yesterday’s gone, yesterday’s gone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2018: Renu Renu — Rookantha Gunathilake&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2018 was an year of catharsis in many ways. I was able to leave my second job
and transition to my third, work with a group of people whom I enjoy being
around, and work at my own pace. I listen to a lot of Rookantha and &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/tags/synthwave"&gt;Synthwave&lt;/a&gt;
these days, when I need to get deep work done and block out the distractions of the
co-working space we operate out of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Renu Renu&lt;/em&gt; is the 7th track from Roo’s seminal 1988 release &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/lk/album/bambara-pahasa/1440268046"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bambara Pahasa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
With such evergreen hits like the title track, the patriotic anthem &lt;em&gt;Indunil Gangulel&lt;/em&gt;,
&lt;em&gt;Sithin Sina Sisi&lt;/em&gt; (one of my favourite love songs ever), &lt;em&gt;Anatha Maruthe&lt;/em&gt;,
&lt;em&gt;Suwanda Dena Mal Wane&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lande Mula Wee&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Bambara Pahasa&lt;/em&gt; cassette (which I
grew up listening to) marked a high point in the Sri Lankan popular music industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One year later, its greatest ever songwriter Premakeerthi de Alwis was killed in the
midst of an extremely gruesome war between Marxist insurgents and government death squads
that were ready to match and amplify the savagery, marking the start of a slow but steady
decline in both the commercial reach and the artistic achievements of the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the work itself — it isn’t the most exciting in the world. I’m no longer working
with the latest cutting-edge tech and writing code in a language that came out 6 months
ago and Babel transpiles into 16 different varieties of Javascript, but sometimes
&lt;em&gt;boring is good&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This beautiful track is like 3-songs-in-one. Also, Rupavahini should bring back
Saxophonists in naval suits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;රේණු රේණු මල් මිටේ රේණු&lt;br&gt;
ඈට පෙම් කරන්න මට බෑලු&lt;br&gt;
රන් සමනල තටු මට ලැබෙන්නෙ නෑලු&lt;br&gt;
රොන් පිරී සැලෙන්න මල් රේණු&lt;/p&gt;

වැඩිය එරීගෙන හිතන්න වෙලා නැතිවෙනව. කෙලි ප්‍රශ්න, රටේ ප්‍රශ්න, බොන්න ඕනෙ ප්‍රශ්න ඔක්කොම අමතක වෙනව හොඳ

&lt;p&gt;අලුතෙන් දෙයක් කරන්න හිතෙනවනම් ඒ ගිටාර් ගැහිල්ල විතරයි. ඒකත් පොඩ්ඩක් හිමින් සීරුවේ කරන්නෙ, මොකෝ "පාඩම්

&lt;p&gt;I finally left my job of a few months over four years and am currently in the twilight
zone (?) or whatever they call it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also did something very uncharacteristic and went out and bought myself something, a
budget Stratocaster. I don't really play the guitar enough to justify this, and fully 
blame Rob Chapman and Lee Anderton for making me do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The Strat" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/the-strat.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; going through a full-on midlife crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also started binging BoJack Horseman, which has gems like these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, sometimes I feel like I was born with a leak, and any goodness I started with
just slowly spilled out of me, and now it's all gone. And I'll never get it back in me.
It's too late. Life is a series of closing doors, isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not the greatest show to be watching if you're ever in that place where you're not really
sure if you're a good person, and nothing new is happening and you feel like you're
coasting on &lt;em&gt;that one time&lt;/em&gt; you did well (a long long time ago...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="BoJack Horseman" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/bojack.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anywayyy, this wasn't supposed to be &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; negative (you should've seen the first draft)
so we'll wind up here. This means more regular updates on the blog again, hopefully!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="work"></category><category term="uni"></category><category term="people"></category></entry></feed>
