happened and Sri Lanka (and the world) saw the situation worsen drastically.
&lt;a href="https://srilankac19memorial.org/"&gt;We lost many invaluable lives to the virus.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some 2021 personal stats:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Transport&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, I took 556 bus rides. &lt;a href="https://janithl.github.io/2020/01/some-2019-stats/"&gt;In 2019, I took 265.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://janithl.github.io/2021/01/some-2020-stats/"&gt;In 2020, I took 15.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2021, I took &lt;strong&gt;none&lt;/strong&gt;. It would've been irresponsible for me to&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
I've only taken 8 tuk/taxi rides in all of 2021, and 5 of these happened
in the last two months of the year when case numbers subsided. There's
really no point making a graph for just 8 rides so I will skip it, along
with the year-on-year comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Blog&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only published 7 posts in 2021, down from 16 in 2020 and 18 in 2019.
Given the circumstances this year, I am happy with this output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Post Counts from 2009 to 2021" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/2021-2009-post-counts.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Art/Music&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/chithrapotha/"&gt;Chithrapotha, I managed only 36 posts this year&lt;/a&gt;, and a lot of
them were WIP from &lt;a href="https://janithl.github.io/2021/03/paramitha/"&gt;my animated short&lt;/a&gt;. I really should get around to
posting more and stop trying to innovate so much and try new things in
every single piece&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Sometimes we need to do things just for fun and
I need to return to the place of fun and relaxation that made me pick up
painting in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Chithrapotha" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/2021-chithrapotha.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On SoundCloud &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/janith-leanage/sets/2k21"&gt;I managed 7 tracks this year&lt;/a&gt;, which is down from
&lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/janith-leanage/sets/2k20"&gt;8 in 2020&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/janith-leanage/sets/2k19"&gt;18 in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. The big addition this year has been
a MIDI-enabled keyboard that I got at the end of October and which has
opened up new sonic possibilities. Here's to a hope of more exiting
music in 2022!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Spotify/Last.fm&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotify finally became available in Sri Lanka in 2021! This has seen
my &lt;a href="https://www.last.fm/user/JanithL"&gt;Last.fm scrobbles&lt;/a&gt; increase from 123 and 207 in 2019 and 2020,
to a massive 1335 in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Last.fm Artists and Albums" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/2021-lastfm-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My listening peaked in May and then dropped off:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Last.fm Scrobbles" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/2021-lastfm-2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly listening to rock and pop in the evenings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Last.fm Genres" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/2021-lastfm-3.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Anime&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't watch much 2021 anime in 2021 (because holy shit there's a
whole backlog), but out of the shows that I watched, &lt;a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/49738/Heike_Monogatari"&gt;Heike Monogatari&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/42897/Horimiya"&gt;Horimiya&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/38474/Yuru_Camp%E2%96%B3_Season_2"&gt;the second season of Yuru Camp&lt;/a&gt; deserve
mentions for being standout hits. Especially Heike, I believe,
deserves more audience awareness and critical acclaim than it got.
It is yet another Naoko Yamada masterclass in visual storytelling,
and her directorial debut for an outfit other than Kyoto Animation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best 2021 movie I managed to catch was &lt;a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/40787/Josee_to_Tora_to_Sakana-tachi"&gt;Josee to Tora to Sakana-tachi&lt;/a&gt;,
a heart-warming tale of a sheltered girl meeting love and seeing
the world. I also enjoyed the simple storyline and striking art
style of &lt;a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/39175/Cider_no_You_ni_Kotoba_ga_Wakiagaru"&gt;Cider no You ni Kotoba ga Wakiagaru&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/49357/Star_Wars__Visions"&gt;Star Wars: Visions&lt;/a&gt;
also deserves a mention for showing us the Star Wars universe
through the eyes of the best studios in anime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Books&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Goodreads Year in Books" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/2021-books.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2021"&gt;According to Goodreads I have only read 2 books this year&lt;/a&gt;, the
second and third books in Isaac Asimov's Foundation trilogy. I have
a whole stack of books remaining from my pandemic Big Bad Wolf haul
that I need to get through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="text-center text-muted"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, that's been my 2021 in numbers. It had a lot of downs and downs,
but hopefully 2022 is the year we emerge from this scourge and return
to some semblance of normalcy&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with this abundance of caution and never stepping out of

&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rascal_Does_Not_Dream_of_Bunny_Girl_Senpai#Anime"&gt;entire 13-episode anime&lt;/a&gt; AND &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rascal_Does_Not_Dream_of_a_Dreaming_Girl"&gt;its movie&lt;/a&gt;. I usually like to
consume media at a much slower pace and sit with what I’ve just
watched in an episode, but two things colluded in this case to make
me buckle my usual habit: my weekdays are packed (making me wait
till next weekend to finish the series), and the story was just so
good that it kept me hooked wanting to see the next episode of the
arc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not meant to be a review. You will find much better-written
reviews by people with far more anime expertise than I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, let’s talk about why I related so much with the themes of this
show. I think the overarching theme that ran through many of its arcs
is that we all hold on to bad decisions or unfortunate circumstances
from the past, and it prevents us from moving forward with our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the idea of alternate timelines which branch off from the different
decisions that we make. It’s a bit comforting to think that we do have free
will and a world of possibilities exist in front of us. Certainly a far
more uplifting than the idea of fatalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This liking of alternate timelines also leads me down endless computational
time spent agonising over what could’ve been. There are a few train-wrecks
that were inevitable, but I still fantasise about ways to have avoided.
There are the people, there are the circumstances, and there’s how you
dealt with them. It’s a never-ending Rubik's cube of possible arrangements
and rearrangements!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, anyway, my point (if there is any) is that in addition to having anxiety
about your future life and career, you can also have endless fun thinking
about all the ways the past could’ve been different too. Just get creative
with it, and I promise you a never-ending supply of sleepless nights!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="people"></category><category term="biology"></category><category term="films"></category></entry><entry><title>An Update</title><link href="https://janithl.github.io/2021/07/an-update/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-07-16T23:05:00+05:30</published><updated>2021-07-16T23:05:00+05:30</updated><author><name>Janith</name></author><id>tag:janithl.github.io,2021-07-16:/2021/07/an-update/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am alive and... &lt;em&gt;well?&lt;/em&gt; I don’t know much about quantifying wellness—

but in the age of a pandemic—I feel lucky to be healthy. There hasn’t
been much activity in this blog, not just because I have been busy (work
really took over life in quarantine), but because I have had a lot to
say but no way to say it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pandy life has upended a lot of what we take for granted, and made us
reevaluate a lot of what we considered foundational to our being in the
pre-Covid era. Human connections and the directions of our lives and how
we spend “social” time is among them. Now, don’t get me wrong, I still
love my friends, but this time apart without any face-to-face contact (I
last saw them in October! &lt;strong&gt;It’s been 8 months!&lt;/strong&gt;) has been difficult for
everyone. It also made me consider what friendships entail and how far
we are willing to go to maintain friendships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also suddenly very aware of how small my social circle is. Now, my
intentional limiting of social media usage was not much of a concern
pre-pandemic, but as the weeks of social distancing turned into months
I started regretting my choices just a little less. However, seeing the
toxicity on most platforms these days also made me realise why I decided
to cut the cord when I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This period of forced introspection (hah, as if I needed an excuse to look
inward) has also made me more and more aware of the central conflict in my
life: that between the &lt;em&gt;deen&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;dunya&lt;/em&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;lokottara&lt;/em&gt; versus the
&lt;em&gt;laukika&lt;/em&gt;. Do I really want my hopeless romanticism to finally culminate
in the life of a householder—with wife and children in tow—or do I want
to make the best of (what I honestly believe) is an infinitesimally rare
opportunity to break the cycle of samsara?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know this post is disjointed and sounds like the ramblings of an
&lt;em&gt;ummattaka&lt;/em&gt; (because &lt;em&gt;සබ්බේ සත්තා උම්මත්තකෝ&lt;/em&gt;, right?), but I need this as a
waypoint to look back at someday and convince myself that whatever choice
I made here was correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And till that day, happy journeying to you all.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="people"></category><category term="biology"></category><category term="religion"></category></entry><entry><title>Better Halved</title><link href="https://janithl.github.io/2021/01/better-halved/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-01-28T18:30:00+05:30</published><updated>2021-01-28T18:30:00+05:30</updated><author><name>Janith</name></author><id>tag:janithl.github.io,2021-01-28:/2021/01/better-halved/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sometimes&lt;/p&gt;

With the threat of Covid rising (even before the government decided to finally
lockdown in March), I didn’t risk taking cramped public transport. Sadly, I also
understand that working from home and taking a PickMe are not privileges everyone
has access to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A breakdown of all rides taken in 2020 clearly reflect the two waves/lockdowns we
had this year in Sri Lanka:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/chithrapotha/"&gt;Chithrapotha is rolling on&lt;/a&gt;, with 55 posts this year. This is nowhere near the 27
I posted in just over a month when I started it, but I put more effort to finish
pieces now and can never finish them at a rate of one-a-day like I used to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On SoundCloud &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/janith-leanage/sets/2k20"&gt;I only managed 8 tracks this year&lt;/a&gt; (down from &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/janith-leanage/sets/2k19"&gt;18 in 2019&lt;/a&gt;),
mostly due to my recording setup getting fudged by an OS upgrade back in June.
Hopefully, with the new year—and planned hardware upgrades—I’ll be back to recording
a ton of tracks that have piled up on my phone’s voice recording app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="text-center text-muted"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, those are my 2020 stats. &lt;a href="https://janithl.github.io/2020/10/clearing-the-slate/"&gt;It’s not been a great year&lt;/a&gt;, but I’m well aware that
things could’ve been much worse—and I’m grateful for good health and still having all
my loved ones with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sincerely hope 2021 will be a good year for you and yours!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's been a crazy year, and this is the fourth draft of a post that I've
been writing since the middle of August. Just like the music and paintings
I've been working on, I kept hitting a wall where what I wanted to say, and
what I was capable of saying diverged. I'm just tired at this point. I've
tried to be proactive in a year in which that sort of thing just wasn't
meant to be. Talk about a bad &lt;em&gt;nekatha&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

perched on the rooftop balcony overlooking the suburbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You smoke?", she asked pointing the pack at him. Toying momentarily with the
idea of changing his entire personality to fit in (as he often does), he
finally resigned to a quiet "no, thanks". He hoped it didn't come out as some
sort of value judgement, but she had moved on to flicking the Bic lighter and
trying to keep the flame alive, paying no attention to the drama in his head.
She took two drags as the embers matched the colour of the setting sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Don't you feel like we've fallen short?", she asked as the street below
slowly filled up with the occupants of their office building leaving for
their homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I guess we have. I guess this isn't what our parents had in mind."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She took a look at her toes as she took another drag, and silence descended
on them. He didn't really mind silences, but he also didn't have a rapport
with her yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"No plans to hop on a boat?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Not at least until I'm done with college, no. And even then, I quite like it
here."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ah yes, the comfortable prison of the familiar and the known", he thought—and
wisely kept to himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"And you? Big shot computer man? Can't you earn way more over there?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He could, he said. Maybe next year. It's the lie he told all his relatives,
being as much a prisoner as she was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a chance meeting that happened because of a dare, this evening was going
pretty well, he thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="text-center text-muted"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Machang you always give talk but you &lt;em&gt;never. follow. through.&lt;/em&gt; Always close.
Always no cigar."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Don't harass him, he's clearly still not over you know who."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What nonsense men, I'm perfectly over her"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Prove it"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Come on, I'm not 15 any more no?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you ask her out I will quit ciggies for a month."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Pinky promise. See? I'm not hung up about how adult I am."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="text-center text-muted"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was honestly the weirdest couple of minutes of his life. A diehard introvert
who was just short of wearing "INFP" in bold lettering on his t-shirt every day
(and that too for fear of attracting too much attention—much preferring
monochromatic clothes), he barged into her office and asked if it was the meeting
room, knowing fully well from his 2 years working in this building that it wasn't.
She said that it wasn't, and in her usual cheery and helpful manner assisted him
to find his 'intended' destination on the other side of the floor. He thanked her
and they exchanged names. Three days later, and a couple of 'totally unexpected'
moments bumping into each other on elevators and stairwells, they were on this
rooftop sharing tobacco smoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They should have Google Calendars for the meeting rooms."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Oh yeah, that would sort a lot of the messes out", he replied, and he knew what
the next line was going to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You guys would block out most of it anyway".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looked apologetic, and then they both laughed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They should also maybe add floor maps so people don't get lost...". Her lips were
curling into a mischievous smile, and her deep brown eyes glistened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ye... yeah they should."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I mean, three days ago I saw a man I've seen use the second floor meeting room at
least half a dozen times suddenly lose his bearings and walk into an office on the
other side of the building." She was pointedly avoiding your gaze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I..."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She took another drag, and smoke escaped her smiling teeth as she looked over the
coconut tree tops turning orange red with the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You really sure you don't want a smoke?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While initially driven by post-Easter attack paranoia, environmental factors have
also been a concern especially with the increase in average temperatures. Although
still a firm believer in public transport, I no longer wanted to turn up at work a
sweaty mess. Let's hope A/C buses start rolling out on the 138 route soon&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. 🙏🏽&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the ride counts and average fares for 2019 in comparison to 2018:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td align="right"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-180&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huh, never realised I'd taken 180 less journeys in total this year. Must be all the
sleeping in on weekends. 🙈&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other Expenses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've bought food 247 times in 2019, up from 200 times in 2018. The average order
value has gone up slightly, from 572 LKR to 600 LKR. I've bought clothing 4 times,
up from just 2 times in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've made 16 purchases on AliExpress this year, up from 5 purchases last year. The
average order value has stayed roughly the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Social Media&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been on a bit of a hiatus from Twitter and Instagram, with only 6
images posted on my IG this year (and none since June). But I did start
&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/chithrapotha/"&gt;an Instagram purely for my illustrations&lt;/a&gt; and I've managed to post about 29
posts in the space of a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Chithrapotha" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/chithrapotha.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing more and putting it out there is a goal that I want to work towards
in 2020. I've also uploaded 18 song snippets to my SoundCloud, and plan to upload
longer and more developed pieces in 2020 (fingers crossed!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="text-center text-muted"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, those are some of my stats for the year. How has 2019 been for you
and how do you plan to spend your 2020?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
window.onload = function() {
   $('table').addClass('table table-bordered table-condensed'); 
}
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still don't have an Uber account, and don't plan on getting one.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And eventually we can all take the Kelani Valley railway, which is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nuuuwan/status/1203260223378604033"&gt;currently incredibly under-utilised&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="text-center"&gt;Yes, but can Liberals batter down doors anymore?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="text-center"&gt;Yes, but can Liberals batter down doors anymore?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night, dealing with a bought of insomnia, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/29/lesson-in-boris-johnson-jolliness-liberal-miserabilsm-is-a-turn-off"&gt;I read this important take on BoJo&lt;/a&gt;
(not to be confused with BoJack) and the conservative wave sweeping across not just the
UK but most of the world. While there might be a few points of contention, I think
overall it was a good state of the union on liberalism and what I like to think is a
bit of a disease among educated liberals: the refusal and lack of confidence in pushing
our agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="text-center text-muted"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Born at the tail end of the Berlin Wall and the Soviet Union, my generation was very
liberal and expected the generations that followed us to be even more so. The online
communities where we came of age were incredibly inclusive, liberal, and &lt;em&gt;"woke"&lt;/em&gt;. And
yet, woke culture itself overextended and exposed the flanks, leading to the almost
&lt;em&gt;unthinkable&lt;/em&gt; scenario of an incredibly right-leaning younger generation, and the liberal
and free thinking communities of our youth turned to the right as a reaction to the
seeming &lt;em&gt;authoritarianism of the new left&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;yoofs&lt;/em&gt; were also very much multiculturally aware, having grown up with access to
different &lt;em&gt;lived experiences&lt;/em&gt; via the internet, and very much sensitive to what it saw as
liberal intolerances of differing opinions, as well as seeming mollycoddling of the more
bigoted minorities within minorities. To the kids growing up on Gangam Style, it was no
longer western values at stake but an overarching global value structure&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which was
threatened not by the traditional scapegoat of crusty and rich old conservatives&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but
by increasingly intolerant, tone deaf, preachy ivory tower PC liberals.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="text-center text-muted"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short: Even though there is a lot of hope left in the world and its youth (in
the form of e.g. Greta Thunberg, CAA protestors in Indian universities, and the younger
remain voters at the Brexit polls), it is still disheartening to see some in such an educated
and informed generation turn towards reactionism over progressivism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the libs, it is time to regroup and look inward. We must reflect on the past decade, the
victories (MARRIAGE EQUALITY!) and the bitter defeats, and consider what we value the most,
what our core inviolable principles are. Lines might have to be drawn where our usual support
for personal preferences and freedoms infringe on the rights of the other and the collective&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
It is time to raise those voices in battle cries, as the rich keep becoming richer, and use
their money and influence to sow division among the working man to further their own ends. We
don't have much time—the greed of our race has set the planet on fire. The rich will burrow
underneath and survive, but what of us poor proles? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="text-center text-muted"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is time to step away from books and back into society. It's time to make welfare great again,
fight for unionisation and the rights of the worker and the downtrodden. Come to the understanding
that humanity isn't perfect, but that we must struggle to make this planet and our society better,
more equitable and more inclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's time to bring back civil discourse, please, and thank you. No one likes being talked down to,
or being called racist because they were simply well-meaning but ignorant. Bring back the humanity,
bring back the fight, bring back Travellers on the Discovery Channel. Shout from the rooftops
&lt;em&gt;how awesome science is&lt;/em&gt;, and how excited we are about exploring outer space, reforesting our
planet, or curing disease. Stand against bigotry, while also acknowledging that bigotry is bigotry
regardless of the source. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3U6rRK9ul0"&gt;As the great Imtiaz Bakeer Markar once said&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think not in terms of &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; is right and who is wrong, but &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; is right and what is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would argue this dates back to enlightenment thinking and classical liberalism.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still very much the actual villain—see Prince Andrew.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally do not believe it is a zero sum game. Living in a republic is based on a
social contract, and some individualistic excesses might have to be forgone in the service of cohesion.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

So that leaves me at my most comfortable—a good old conversation
with myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is beauty in solitude. You only truly begin to appreciate it
as you get older. At long last you feel validated that the things
you felt growing up as a shy and introverted only-child have real
world applications!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Society doesn't feel this way about solitude. It sees the uncoupled
male as some sort of threat that has to be neutralised at all cost.
The same relatives who threatened to box your ears if you so much
as looked in the direction of the opposite sex now expect you to bed
a complete stranger. South Asian families are whack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it's just so very amazing to be on your own and really
appreciate it. Like how you appreciate your head ceasing to spin
after a really heavy night of drinking. You just sit there being
thankful for the ordinary, the sober. And that's beautiful, isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;

Well, the tab arrived in the mail today, and I want to share some of my experiments on
my first day of digital art!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Second Drawing" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/sketches/digital-2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first few attempts (above) were predictably terrible, but I began realising that my
usual &lt;a href="https://janithl.github.io/2019/11/ive-been-sketching/"&gt;sketching&lt;/a&gt; and watercolouring techniques weren't the best match for the medium,
because digital was something else entirely! As I told Dili, "it's like working with clay,
I can mould this shit all day". And that was my lightbulb moment, the fact that I can
mould the light and shadows to create shapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Digital Drawing" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/sketches/digital-3.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's been a lot of fun, and this next piece took only 45 minutes. Having an undo button,
an eraser, and all the brushes in the world&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is definitely expanding the possibilities
for my limited artistic ability. It's like giving FL Studio to a kid who wants to write
music but can't play an instrument&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t go away. None of it does. No matter how kind or forgiving
you are, the stains of the &lt;em&gt;‘bad times’&lt;/em&gt; stay on like fountain pen
ink on white fabric, refusing to budge. All they need is some mild
reoccurrence to go full-on #ThrowbackThursday&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="text-center text-muted"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I a bad …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Mountains" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/mountains.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="text-center text-muted"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I a bad person? Was she a bad person? Do we tell each other that
we’re good people to avoid the painful truth that maybe we weren’t
good to each other? That we did things that were downright mean, but
always with the cover of “but I &lt;em&gt;meant&lt;/em&gt; well”.
&lt;em&gt;Cetanaham bhikkhave kammam vadami,&lt;/em&gt; but does the intent lessen the
pain of the person suffering?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="text-center text-muted"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You always seem to attract the destructive type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— a very good friend I haven’t kept in touch with enough&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="text-center text-muted"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People rarely are what they seem on the surface, and that includes yourself.
You know, it doesn’t matter how good your unit test suite is if the train
tracks don’t line up and your integrations fail? It’s the same with people.
No matter how much you think you know yourself, it takes deep, meaningful
and prolonged interaction with another to know what you’re &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="text-center text-muted"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you ever worry that they’ll never appreciate you for who you are? That
you’ll never match up to the version of you in their heads? That they’ll
never know the &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; of your quirks and your ideals, or worse, they’ll
never &lt;em&gt;care&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="text-center text-muted"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sad reality is that [he] has gone head first completely into this.
Willingly. He doesn’t want to get out. He just wants it to conform to his liking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We might see from here that these two aren’t compatible but the fact it until
they decide to let go, we can scream blue murder but it’s not going to do anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[He] has not reached his breaking point. Until then all we can do is commiserate,
love him when he cries, and hope this works out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— a very good friend that I thankfully get to see every week or two&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="text-center text-muted"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Esto Perpetua&lt;/em&gt;. I only got to attend that good school for two years, but the
motto will always stay with me because it spoke to my soul. Be thou forever.
Don’t be afraid to be your own true self, warts and all. Life is too short to
be constantly feel like you’re walking on eggshells, hiding away parts of your
&lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt;, and isolating yourself from the people and activities that meant things
to you. Nothing, and no one, is worth that.&lt;/p&gt;

a member of a minority (and yet, a privileged minority in many ways).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romeo adored Juliet. They had rarely spoken, but he was an ardent
follower of her work since his teens. He was very much smitten, amazed
at how every word she laid down on paper seemed to emanate a softness,
a warmth, a humanity — a deep love and kindness that he saw reflected
in her eyes whenever they rarely did meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in those years of quiet romance from afar, the Capulets went through
their fair share of trials. They were branded traitors to the nation, a
force hell bent on bringing down the Montegues from within. Two-tongued
and devious, driven by a long-term ideology and short-term niceties. A
fifth-column that has waited patiently for centuries for its chance to strike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romeo saw parallels though. He saw the same humanity he saw within his
Montegue friends within Juliet and the dozens of other Capulet friends
he had. He felt that they were all being taken for a ride by those within
the clans that wished for nothing but conflict, for conflict was profitable.
The silent and peaceful (and yet very mistrusting) masses being led for a
ride by those who hogged the limelight, the radicals, the firebrands, the
ones who could easily call for the head of anyone sane who stood up to
them and for common humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t how the future was supposed to look. We were supposed to be the
post-war generation which had learned lessons which were never to be repeated.
We grew up in our multi-cultural schools and with friends from all over. We
had an internet to connect us, Snapchat filters to unite us, a soundtrack of
our youth that we shared with kids from America. Where did it all go so
horribly wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romeo was tired of reality, and very much wished that Juliet was the one
penning the story instead, with that familiar softness, warmth, and humanity
emanating from every word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently read an article about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_determinism"&gt;Hard Determinism&lt;/a&gt;, the theory that there
is no free will, and that given the initial values of things like the physical
constants (the speed of light, the gravitational constant &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt; etc), a universe
would evolve, and of it matter, and of it sentient beings, and of those beings
one would inevitably be sitting in a tuk at a petrol shed typing out these words,
and another would be sitting somewhere reading them just life you. It’s the idea
that everything has been decided ahead of time, and we’re merely playing our parts
in a grand cosmic script over which we have no control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hope that’s &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; the case, and it doesn’t sit well with one of my
(admittedly few) very strongly held beliefs: that each individual, and only s/he,
can determine their reality and the story they write of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, &lt;em&gt;boy oh boy&lt;/em&gt; does it feel like you don’t have a choice sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, personally, the biggest factor keeping me from living life the way I want
to live it is &lt;em&gt;obligations&lt;/em&gt;; I feel very strongly about words I’ve given, or
responsibilities someone has entrusted in me. I go to insane lengths sometimes to
keep my word, putting my own welfare and happiness in jeopardy, and feel intense
guilt when you inevitably fail sometimes to fulfill that obligation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might sound like a innocuous enough problem to have, but it isn’t. I often end
up in situations which range from the awkward to the borderline hazardous because I
don’t set realistic expectations, set boundaries, or don’t say no enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post has no grand message, but I’ve had a shitty month so far, and:&lt;br&gt;
a) &lt;a href="https://alifeofsaturdays.wordpress.com/2019/01/27/reasons-not-to-write/"&gt;Adilah’s lovely post about excuses not to write&lt;/a&gt;, and&lt;br&gt;
b) &lt;a href="https://thamara.blog/expectations-97685dd85811"&gt;Thamara’s about managing expectations&lt;/a&gt;, made me just want to get this out of my system. 🤷&lt;/p&gt;

like it was worth pursuing — all the world’s problems could be solved
with code, y’know? — and the internet was new, exciting, and as yet
relatively uncommercialised. I was going through a major Britpop phase
and this anthem seemed to best capture the spirit of the age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="text-center"&gt;My favourite member of the band was obviously Guigsy, the bassist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you’re the same as me&lt;br&gt;
We see things they’ll never see&lt;br&gt;
You and I are gonna live forever&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were no limits back then, no wary old voice at the back of your
head saying &lt;em&gt;“someone must’ve written a library for this before”&lt;/em&gt;, or
&lt;em&gt;“if this is worth anything Google would’ve done it already”.&lt;/em&gt; Bus route
finders and blog aggregators just sprung up, with hopelessly naive yet
somehow (barely) functioning code that got the job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2012: A Certain Romance — Arctic Monkeys&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My final year of uni was happening, and there was a real chance of me failing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, this might’ve been an overreaction to the statement by a
lecturer that last year’s batch had done awfully, and half had flunked their
finals. But I was fed up of the years of uni I’d already been through, and
wanted to finally be a salaryman. No chances were hence taken, and no quarter
given. From the end of the day’s lecturers right up until 8 PM when the library
closed down, I would be in there studying. Every. Single. Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were some perks. Pretty librarians, and even prettier girls. Nothing
(obviously) came of it, but I got introduced to a lot of good music: Hendrix,
Clapton, and the Monkeys from Sheffield. I still consider their debut album
— chronicling a night out clubbing— one of the finest ever crafted. Alex Turner
was barely 20 at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="700" height="393" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RyEiRKJJr6A"

&lt;p class="text-center"&gt;Alex ❤&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well over there, there’s friends of mine&lt;br&gt;
What can I say? I’ve known ’em for a long long time&lt;br&gt;
And yeah they might overstep the line&lt;br&gt;
But I just cannot get angry in the same way&lt;br&gt;
Not in the same way&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I passed. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2017: Don’t Stop — Fleetwood Mac&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was it even a &lt;strong&gt;break up&lt;/strong&gt; if you didn’t listen to &lt;strong&gt;Rumours&lt;/strong&gt;
by &lt;strong&gt;Fleetwood Mac&lt;/strong&gt; at least 6 times?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was trudging through my second job like a British tax inspector through a cold
thunderstorm. The project I was working through had been through 6 weeks of hell
and back — all to deliver a product that would’ve taken &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; number of weeks in
&lt;em&gt;half the time&lt;/em&gt;, all because it had been sold to the client as something that
could be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone involved in that sales pitch had disappeared, and a team of mostly
greenhorns had to spend late nights and weekends, clocking up 100-hour weeks for
this impossible goal. There was a week where I had spent 6 midnights in a row at
the office. We’d go home at 2 AM (on a good day) and be back at work at 9 AM for
the morning client call with the team in Brisbane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As 2017 ended, and I spent Christmas ‘holidays’ in an empty office working, my
mind was set on quitting as soon as possible. The only thing keeping me going
were the breakup songs playing through my tinny headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="700" height="393" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QV9JJmSCiI8"

&lt;p class="text-center"&gt;Everyone needs some of that coke in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wake up and don’t want to smile&lt;br&gt;
If it takes just a little while&lt;br&gt;
Open your eyes and look at the day&lt;br&gt;
You’ll see things in a different way&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t stop thinking about tomorrow&lt;br&gt;
Don’t stop, it’ll soon be here&lt;br&gt;
It’ll be, better than before&lt;br&gt;
Yesterday’s gone, yesterday’s gone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2018: Renu Renu — Rookantha Gunathilake&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2018 was an year of catharsis in many ways. I was able to leave my second job
and transition to my third, work with a group of people whom I enjoy being
around, and work at my own pace. I listen to a lot of Rookantha and &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/tags/synthwave"&gt;Synthwave&lt;/a&gt;
these days, when I need to get deep work done and block out the distractions of the
co-working space we operate out of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Renu Renu&lt;/em&gt; is the 7th track from Roo’s seminal 1988 release &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/lk/album/bambara-pahasa/1440268046"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bambara Pahasa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
With such evergreen hits like the title track, the patriotic anthem &lt;em&gt;Indunil Gangulel&lt;/em&gt;,
&lt;em&gt;Sithin Sina Sisi&lt;/em&gt; (one of my favourite love songs ever), &lt;em&gt;Anatha Maruthe&lt;/em&gt;,
&lt;em&gt;Suwanda Dena Mal Wane&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lande Mula Wee&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Bambara Pahasa&lt;/em&gt; cassette (which I
grew up listening to) marked a high point in the Sri Lankan popular music industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One year later, its greatest ever songwriter Premakeerthi de Alwis was killed in the
midst of an extremely gruesome war between Marxist insurgents and government death squads
that were ready to match and amplify the savagery, marking the start of a slow but steady
decline in both the commercial reach and the artistic achievements of the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the work itself — it isn’t the most exciting in the world. I’m no longer working
with the latest cutting-edge tech and writing code in a language that came out 6 months
ago and Babel transpiles into 16 different varieties of Javascript, but sometimes
&lt;em&gt;boring is good&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This beautiful track is like 3-songs-in-one. Also, Rupavahini should bring back
Saxophonists in naval suits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;රේණු රේණු මල් මිටේ රේණු&lt;br&gt;

zone (?) or whatever they call it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also did something very uncharacteristic and went out and bought myself something, a
budget Stratocaster. I don't really play the guitar enough to justify this, and fully 
blame Rob Chapman and Lee Anderton for making me do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The Strat" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/the-strat.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; going through a full-on midlife crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also started binging BoJack Horseman, which has gems like these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, sometimes I feel like I was born with a leak, and any goodness I started with
just slowly spilled out of me, and now it's all gone. And I'll never get it back in me.
It's too late. Life is a series of closing doors, isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not the greatest show to be watching if you're ever in that place where you're not really
sure if you're a good person, and nothing new is happening and you feel like you're
coasting on &lt;em&gt;that one time&lt;/em&gt; you did well (a long long time ago...)&lt;/p&gt;

I got a lot of time to sit down and reflect, and I grow thankful every day for
the people who choose to stand by me despite all my shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of 2016, let me turn the things that made me happy this year into
a Top 5 list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;1. I got to travel&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since "the incident" of Feb 2014, I've not really travelled as much as I
would've normally liked to. This year though began with some travel: to
Pasikuda with the family. Places I got to travel to this year includes that
and our usual annual trips to Kandy, Anuradhapura (and Yapahuwa, a first for 
me), &lt;a href="https://janithl.github.io/2016/09/somawathiya-september-2016/"&gt;Somawathiya&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Deep South&lt;/em&gt; (Katharagama, Mulkirigala etc.) and 
some really fun day trips Down South with the co-workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Deep South Instagrams" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/deep-south.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was particularly happy with the pics I got to take on the Deep South trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;2. I got to learn&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... both in and out of the classroom. In the classroom I tried to wrap my head
around ML techniques, &lt;a href="https://janithl.github.io/2016/08/and-so-it-began/"&gt;neural nets&lt;/a&gt;, advanced DBs and their ilk. Outside
of it, I got to play with React quite a bit, learn &lt;a href="https://laravel.com/"&gt;Laravel&lt;/a&gt; in a (cramped)
couple of months and push out live systems almost immediately (what a beautiful
framework, has changed the way I write PHP for the better). I got to dabble in
more Python than I ever got to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got into &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzZCiVjRPPDCpP5l7HIGRtA"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3Wj9aO8VS5ZuXrtWfJf81w"&gt;crazy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCOIcdii1bQmfSPHeNNw4Qw"&gt;YouTube channels&lt;/a&gt; that inspired me to pick 
up my guitar after years, adjust the truss rod and play some barre chords. I
followed Casey Neistat as he built and sold a company, and let John Green
teach me history like I was taking my AP exams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;3. I got time off&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got three months off to write my thesis' lit review, write this blog, &lt;a href="https://janithl.github.io/2016/09/the-unp-at-70/"&gt;write 
about the UNP&lt;/a&gt; and write code to buff up my Github profile. I started working
at YAMU the week after I was done with my final exam at uni, and I never got a 
proper break since. Those 3 months let me put everything in perspective and 
helped me decide what I really wanted to do with my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;4. I got bald&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, started balding. Not really fussed about it. (I feel that) I am well aware 
of my mortality, and that I'm no longer the youngest guy in the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;5. I got to let go&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... of some important things which I once thought would stay with me for (most
of my) life. It was much easier than I thought and I feel much better for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is a stream and hanging on to a bank is not going to help when eventually
we all need to float away. Or so I feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Facebook Year in Review" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/fb-2016.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that's been my year. It wasn't terrible personally by a long stretch, but
it was certainly challenging and 2017 promises to be even more so. I hope you've
all had a good year, and wish you all the best for the next one. Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
