&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2011: Live Forever — Oasis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These were the heady days of youthful exuberance, when any idea seemed
like it was worth pursuing — all the world’s problems could be solved
with code, y’know? — and the internet was new, exciting, and as yet
relatively uncommercialised. I was going through a major Britpop phase
and this anthem seemed to best capture the spirit of the age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i_2mWhfOhGU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p class="text-center"&gt;My favourite member of the band was obviously Guigsy, the bassist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you’re the same as me&lt;br&gt;
We see things they’ll never see&lt;br&gt;
You and I are gonna live forever&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were no limits back then, no wary old voice at the back of your
head saying &lt;em&gt;“someone must’ve written a library for this before”&lt;/em&gt;, or
&lt;em&gt;“if this is worth anything Google would’ve done it already”.&lt;/em&gt; Bus route
finders and blog aggregators just sprung up, with hopelessly naive yet
somehow (barely) functioning code that got the job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2012: A Certain Romance — Arctic Monkeys&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My final year of uni was happening, and there was a real chance of me failing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, this might’ve been an overreaction to the statement by a
lecturer that last year’s batch had done awfully, and half had flunked their
finals. But I was fed up of the years of uni I’d already been through, and
wanted to finally be a salaryman. No chances were hence taken, and no quarter
given. From the end of the day’s lecturers right up until 8 PM when the library
closed down, I would be in there studying. Every. Single. Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were some perks. Pretty librarians, and even prettier girls. Nothing
(obviously) came of it, but I got introduced to a lot of good music: Hendrix,
Clapton, and the Monkeys from Sheffield. I still consider their debut album
— chronicling a night out clubbing— one of the finest ever crafted. Alex Turner
was barely 20 at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="700" height="393" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RyEiRKJJr6A" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p class="text-center"&gt;Alex ❤&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well over there, there’s friends of mine&lt;br&gt;
What can I say? I’ve known ’em for a long long time&lt;br&gt;
And yeah they might overstep the line&lt;br&gt;
But I just cannot get angry in the same way&lt;br&gt;
Not in the same way&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I passed. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2017: Don’t Stop — Fleetwood Mac&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was it even a &lt;strong&gt;break up&lt;/strong&gt; if you didn’t listen to &lt;strong&gt;Rumours&lt;/strong&gt;
by &lt;strong&gt;Fleetwood Mac&lt;/strong&gt; at least 6 times?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was trudging through my second job like a British tax inspector through a cold
thunderstorm. The project I was working through had been through 6 weeks of hell
and back — all to deliver a product that would’ve taken &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; number of weeks in
&lt;em&gt;half the time&lt;/em&gt;, all because it had been sold to the client as something that
could be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone involved in that sales pitch had disappeared, and a team of mostly
greenhorns had to spend late nights and weekends, clocking up 100-hour weeks for
this impossible goal. There was a week where I had spent 6 midnights in a row at
the office. We’d go home at 2 AM (on a good day) and be back at work at 9 AM for
the morning client call with the team in Brisbane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As 2017 ended, and I spent Christmas ‘holidays’ in an empty office working, my
mind was set on quitting as soon as possible. The only thing keeping me going
were the breakup songs playing through my tinny headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="700" height="393" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QV9JJmSCiI8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p class="text-center"&gt;Everyone needs some of that coke in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wake up and don’t want to smile&lt;br&gt;
If it takes just a little while&lt;br&gt;
Open your eyes and look at the day&lt;br&gt;
You’ll see things in a different way&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t stop thinking about tomorrow&lt;br&gt;
Don’t stop, it’ll soon be here&lt;br&gt;
It’ll be, better than before&lt;br&gt;
Yesterday’s gone, yesterday’s gone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2018: Renu Renu — Rookantha Gunathilake&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2018 was an year of catharsis in many ways. I was able to leave my second job
and transition to my third, work with a group of people whom I enjoy being
around, and work at my own pace. I listen to a lot of Rookantha and &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/tags/synthwave"&gt;Synthwave&lt;/a&gt;
these days, when I need to get deep work done and block out the distractions of the
co-working space we operate out of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Renu Renu&lt;/em&gt; is the 7th track from Roo’s seminal 1988 release &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/lk/album/bambara-pahasa/1440268046"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bambara Pahasa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
With such evergreen hits like the title track, the patriotic anthem &lt;em&gt;Indunil Gangulel&lt;/em&gt;,
&lt;em&gt;Sithin Sina Sisi&lt;/em&gt; (one of my favourite love songs ever), &lt;em&gt;Anatha Maruthe&lt;/em&gt;,
&lt;em&gt;Suwanda Dena Mal Wane&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lande Mula Wee&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Bambara Pahasa&lt;/em&gt; cassette (which I
grew up listening to) marked a high point in the Sri Lankan popular music industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One year later, its greatest ever songwriter Premakeerthi de Alwis was killed in the
midst of an extremely gruesome war between Marxist insurgents and government death squads
that were ready to match and amplify the savagery, marking the start of a slow but steady
decline in both the commercial reach and the artistic achievements of the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the work itself — it isn’t the most exciting in the world. I’m no longer working
with the latest cutting-edge tech and writing code in a language that came out 6 months
ago and Babel transpiles into 16 different varieties of Javascript, but sometimes
&lt;em&gt;boring is good&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This beautiful track is like 3-songs-in-one. Also, Rupavahini should bring back
Saxophonists in naval suits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;රේණු රේණු මල් මිටේ රේණු&lt;br&gt;
ඈට පෙම් කරන්න මට බෑලු&lt;br&gt;
රන් සමනල තටු මට ලැබෙන්නෙ නෑලු&lt;br&gt;
රොන් පිරී සැලෙන්න මල් රේණු&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;සඳවත දෝ මා දුටුවේ&lt;br&gt;
ඔබෙ ගත දෝ මා දුටුවේ&lt;br&gt;
සිතුවම් දෝ මා දුටුවේ&lt;br&gt;
හැබැහින් දෝ ඔබ දුටුවේ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally left my job of a few months over four years and am currently in the twilight
zone (?) or whatever they call it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also did something very uncharacteristic and went out and bought myself something, a
budget Stratocaster. I don't really play the guitar enough to justify this, and fully 
blame Rob Chapman and Lee Anderton for making me do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The Strat" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/the-strat.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; going through a full-on midlife crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also started binging BoJack Horseman, which has gems like these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, sometimes I feel like I was born with a leak, and any goodness I started with
just slowly spilled out of me, and now it's all gone. And I'll never get it back in me.
It's too late. Life is a series of closing doors, isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not the greatest show to be watching if you're ever in that place where you're not really
sure if you're a good person, and nothing new is happening and you feel like you're
coasting on &lt;em&gt;that one time&lt;/em&gt; you did well (a long long time ago...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anywayyy, this wasn't supposed to be &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; negative (you should've seen the first draft)
so we'll wind up here.

I got a lot of time to sit down and reflect, and I grow thankful every day for
the people who choose to stand by me despite all my shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of 2016, let me turn the things that made me happy this year into
a Top 5 list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;1. I got to travel&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since "the incident" of Feb 2014, I've not really travelled as much as I
would've normally liked to. This year though began with some travel: to
Pasikuda with the family. Places I got to travel to this year includes that
and our usual annual trips to Kandy, Anuradhapura (and Yapahuwa, a first for 
me), &lt;a href="https://janithl.github.io/2016/09/somawathiya-september-2016/"&gt;Somawathiya&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Deep South&lt;/em&gt; (Katharagama, Mulkirigala etc.) and 
some really fun day trips Down South with the co-workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Deep South Instagrams" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/deep-south.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was particularly happy with the pics I got to take on the Deep South trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;2. I got to learn&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... both in and out of the classroom. In the classroom I tried to wrap my head
around ML techniques, &lt;a href="https://janithl.github.io/2016/08/and-so-it-began/"&gt;neural nets&lt;/a&gt;, advanced DBs and their ilk. Outside
of it, I got to play with React quite a bit, learn &lt;a href="https://laravel.com/"&gt;Laravel&lt;/a&gt; in a (cramped)
couple of months and push out live systems almost immediately (what a beautiful
framework, has changed the way I write PHP for the better). I got to dabble in
more Python than I ever got to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got into &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzZCiVjRPPDCpP5l7HIGRtA"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3Wj9aO8VS5ZuXrtWfJf81w"&gt;crazy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCOIcdii1bQmfSPHeNNw4Qw"&gt;YouTube channels&lt;/a&gt; that inspired me to pick 
up my guitar after years, adjust the truss rod and play some barre chords. I
followed Casey Neistat as he built and sold a company, and let John Green
teach me history like I was taking my AP exams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;3. I got time off&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got three months off to write my thesis' lit review, write this blog, &lt;a href="https://janithl.github.io/2016/09/the-unp-at-70/"&gt;write 
about the UNP&lt;/a&gt; and write code to buff up my Github profile. I started working
at YAMU the week after I was done with my final exam at uni, and I never got a 
proper break since. Those 3 months let me put everything in perspective and 
helped me decide what I really wanted to do with my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;4. I got bald&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, started balding. Not really fussed about it. (I feel that) I am well aware 
of my mortality, and that I'm no longer the youngest guy in the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;5. I got to let go&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... of some important things which I once thought would stay with me for (most
of my) life. It was much easier than I thought and I feel much better for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is a stream and hanging on to a bank is not going to help when eventually
we all need to float away. Or so I feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Facebook Year in Review" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/fb-2016.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that's been my year. It wasn't terrible personally by a long stretch, but
it was certainly challenging and 2017 promises to be even more so. I hope you've
all had a good year, and wish you all the best for the next one.

&lt;p&gt;The wisest programmer I've ever met once said that software development 
at scale is all about &lt;em&gt;"letting go"&lt;/em&gt;. I won't say I'm anywhere near 
that level of Zen, but I'm certainly much less OCD about the giant fire 
in the room. It's a pointless to make reversing entropy your life's work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has proven to be much more difficult than I imagined, not because I don't
have fictional characters that I can relate to, but because...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, see, this is the thing. There are parts of yourself, character traits, 
that you like to think define you. These are all great and noble things, the 
Gryffindor of character traits, all golden and perfect. The naked truth,
though, is that that's what you &lt;em&gt;want to be&lt;/em&gt;, not really who you are in reality. 
When you do, in the sober light of day, do an honest assessment of things, you 
do fall desperately short in quite a few departments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhoo, after days of thinking about this, I finally got my three:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Harrymort, &lt;a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seventh Horcrux&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear god, I really wanted to write about how much I &lt;strong&gt;absolutely LOVED&lt;/strong&gt; this 
fanfic. And I &lt;em&gt;despise&lt;/em&gt; fanfics as a rule. But please, guys, do yourselves a 
favour: get off that Pottermore trash and read &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;. Pliss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Harrymort" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/harrymort.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Harrymort is brilliant (and described by the author as "a series of bad 
decisions executed well"). He is remorseless and persistent, and did I mention 
brilliant? These are all character traits I tend to fanboy over, being so 
intelligent that even when you mess up, you've done such a good job of it that 
your failures are just as spectacular as when you win. They don't really 
describe me though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Evanesco troll," I murmured. The troll disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hero worship filled my minion's Weasley eyes. "Wicked."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hermione asked, "Where did it go?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shrugged. "Where does anything that's vanished go?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stood there for a few minutes, contemplating the nature of nonexistence. At 
least that's what I was doing. I don't know about the children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, shortly after we all should have died horrible deaths via bludgeoning, 
the professors arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I do relate to a lot is his constant paranoia, and seeing conspiracies and 
intrigue everywhere (because if you're doing it, everyone else must be too, 
right?). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrymort is so wrapped up in his lies that he starts to believe them, like his
absolute assertion that Hermione is a dark witch, Ron's a werewolf, and that
Muggle-born wizards and witches have been left behind by their magical parents 
with Muggles acting as childcare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I absolutely adore him. GO READ, NOW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Mark Brendanawicz, &lt;em&gt;Parks and Rec&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Parks and Rec" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/parks-and-rec.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Brendanawicz? More like Brendana-Quits!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why a character from the shows difficult beginnings? Why a really bland and 
unlovable character who didn't make an impact from a show full of strong and 
lovable characters?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After years of his life wasted in the city planning (a subject I deeply love) 
department, he finally quit to go work in the private sector. He makes silly 
decisions (Ann), breaks his legs, almost humiliates himself with by proposing 
to a woman who's about to break up with him, and leaves behind the people he
&lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; loved (Leslie). Despite all the crashing and burning, he was perhaps
one of the most realistic characters in a show full of superhumans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They even threw out his plans for the park and got someone from Eagleton (!!) 
to redraw the thing. Such is life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Max Fischer, &lt;em&gt;Rushmore&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Max Fischer" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/max-rosemary.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, just like Max, like to think of myself as a grown-up and an intellectual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I, just like Max, am nothing of the sort. When you finally do meet an actual 
adult (like Rosemary - who Max sees as an &lt;em&gt;equal&lt;/em&gt; and a potential partner), your 
embarrassing childishness shows, you are incapable of processing how to handle 
a real relationship, and your Latin is terrible (or rather, &lt;em&gt;nonexistent&lt;/em&gt;, 
because you foolishly tried to get rid of it from the curriculum).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, you and Herman deserve each other. You're both little children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we've all been Max at a point in our lives. When we realize that even at 
our best, we're still not &lt;em&gt;good enough&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="people"></category><category term="films"></category><category term="wes anderson"></category></entry><entry><title>When You Say Nothing At All</title><link href="https://janithl.github.io/2016/09/when-you-say-nothing-at-all/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-09-15T06:28:00+05:30</published><updated>2016-09-15T06:28:00+05:30</updated><author><name>Janith</name></author><id>tag:janithl.github.io,2016-09-15:/2016/09/when-you-say-nothing-at-all/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Comic" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/wysnaa-comic.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reliable data on economic livelihoods remain scarce in the developing world, 
hampering efforts to study these outcomes and to design policies that improve 
them. Here we demonstrate an accurate, inexpensive, and scalable method for 
estimating consumption expenditure and asset wealth from high-resolution 
satellite imagery. Using survey and satellite data from five African 
countries—Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, and Rwanda—we show how a 
convolutional neural network can be trained to identify image features that can 
explain up to 75% of the variation in local-level economic outcomes. Our method, 
which requires only publicly available data, could transform efforts to track 
and target poverty in developing countries. It also demonstrates how powerful 
machine learning techniques can be applied in a setting with limited training 
data, suggesting broad potential application across many scientific domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I planned to make short posts on this blog with a bit of a longer submission 
statement (more than one quote, some thoughts added in) than Facebook whenever 
I wanted to share a link, but I haven't been using it in such a way. I should 
start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finishing off with a photo I took on the way back from Matara last week, on the
expressway. It was shot from a moving car, through a window with a filter on it,
and looks terrible in true colour. But grayscale saved it and it has become one
of my favourite shots of clouds I've ever taken, and I love taking pictures of
clouds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making the fundamental error of announcing your plans before you implement them
can cause your brain to reward you before you've accomplished anything, and 
therefore leads you to &lt;a href="http://berkeleysciencereview.com/when-telling-others-about-your-goals-compromises-them/"&gt;not accomplish those plans at all&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research conducted by Peter Gollwitzer has shown that individuals feel closer 
to having achieved their identity goals when their identity-relevant activities 
(e.g., attending medical school) are noticed by others. On the basis of this 
work, Gollwitzer and his colleagues hypothesized that even if others notice 
only our plans for identity-relevant activities, we might also feel closer to 
having achieved our identity goals. Because we then feel closer to having 
achieved our identity goals, we may feel less of a need to actually enact those 
behaviours&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been painfully made aware of how heavy Facebook is, when even scrolling
down the timeline for a minute or two and replying to a few messages can cost a
couple dozen MBs. Makes me wonder how I survived on those 1 GB limited SLT
connections back in the day. But back in the day developers cared about  making
their pages light, unlike now. Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been making progress on my thesis (or its lit review, rather). About 3
more papers and I can forward it to my supervisor for a read-through, I feel.
Very much relieved that I've been able to get this far on things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Took a break from studies today (it &lt;em&gt;IS&lt;/em&gt; Sunday) to do some work on &lt;a href="https://github.com/janithl/Kottu2012"&gt;ol' 
Kottu&lt;/a&gt;. Things have been broken a bit since &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2015/hard-decisions-for-a-sustainable-platform"&gt;Twitter, true to form, 
deprecated useful functionality&lt;/a&gt;. So I got rid of the Twitter share counting,
recalibrated the popularity calculation, and - since I was in there already - 
moved the front-end to use Bootstrap. Because slapping Bootstrap on sites that
have worked perfectly without it is my thing. I'm hoping to deprecate the JQuery 
Mobile-based Kottu Mobile site in favour of the responsive Bootstrap main site 
in the near future, if there aren't any protests and self-immolations.&lt;/p&gt;

I deal with quite often. I rarely have problems with people in my life, because 
I've learned to respect boundaries and not get involved in other people's shit.
But I hopelessly fail sometimes at keeping myself detached from people, and it 
leads to endless suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this amazing &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/2psc9j/my_endless_struggle_with_unrequited_love/"&gt;/r/Buddhism thread&lt;/a&gt; 
this morning that was just perfect, as /r/Buddhism threads often are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout my adolescence and most of my young adulthood I never dated. I used
ideas about attachment and self-reliance as an excuse for not needing to, but
really I just stalled my own development and hurt myself by not finding an
acceptable outlet to express love and practice intimacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hah. So me. "Any relationship I get into will only lead to suffering and 
unskilled behaviour", and all that. The handful of times I've been &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; 
(stretching it, &lt;em&gt;talking&lt;/em&gt;-about-being-with more like) someone, I've been weighed 
down by immense feelings of, for the lack of a better word, Catholic guilt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little over a year ago I saw a girl and was immediately amazed and intrigued
by her. I had the feeling that she was a good friend from my childhood or
someone I had even known from infancy that I was separated from earlier my life.
I doubt this was the case, but it is just the feeling I had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've felt these sorts of connections too, almost sansaric. You find it hard to 
shake the feeling that you're &lt;em&gt;meant&lt;/em&gt; to be with this person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I'm not sure if it was my imagination but I think she had a small crush on
me too because of the way she made extended eye contact and smiled at me
sometimes. But as that happened, I started to feel like it was too good to be
true and I clammed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aha, as is often the case. Be a douchebag and ignore the girls who take the 
time to talk to you, have no trouble perusing ones that don't give you the time
of day (not really, but the clamming up happens...).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few really good replies that take different approaches at looking at 
the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/2psc9j/my_endless_struggle_with_unrequited_love/cmzsv86?context=2"&gt;Altruistic Love&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are attached to someone, you want to be around them because of they 
make you feel good. You enjoy this feeling. It is pleasurable to be loved. What 
this person is to you is, essentially, an object of love. Attachment is about 
self-centered pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you love someone, you want them to experience happiness and pleasure. 
There is no thought of self. If you are the one they are attached to, then 
you want to be near them because it makes them feel good. It is about the giving 
of pleasure, not the receiving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've never seen love and pleasure described in this way before in a Buddhist 
context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people today believe you need a little bit of both. But, from a Buddhist 
perspective, you should love indiscriminately, without attachment to it. And so, 
when it goes away (because it &lt;strong&gt;WILL&lt;/strong&gt; go away... that is the nature of any 
&lt;em&gt;conditioned phenomena&lt;/em&gt;), you are not hurt. This was not about your own pleasure, 
and so you feel no loss. You are not torn from something that pleases you. 
Rather, you recognize that the pleasure that you could once give to this person, 
you no longer can. And that is fine. It is within the nature of a relationship 
for it to end, and so you move forward effortlessly, always giving love 
freely, never attached to it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've often felt that most of my human relationships (about 100% of them 
non-romantic) are about making the other party happy. Whale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/2psc9j/my_endless_struggle_with_unrequited_love/cmzpknj"&gt;Right View&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She's an impermanent, flawed person who pees, poops, farts and belches. Seriously, 
take time to visualize this (it's similar to an actual meditation that the Buddha 
taught, in fact he went more hardcore and asks you to imagine her as a decaying 
corpse...yeesh). She's not a goddess, she's human just like you. &lt;strong&gt;She's not the 
answer to your problems&lt;/strong&gt;, she is--and I think the Buddha would agree with this--
&lt;em&gt;just another bundle of problems&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Totally agree on the &lt;em&gt;bundle of problems&lt;/em&gt; bit, and the sort of work that goes into 
maintaining a relationship, and its downsides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you need to practice is a "Middle Way" of self-esteem. The Buddha taught 
that &lt;em&gt;to physically starve and torture yourself will not bring you enlightenment&lt;/em&gt;, 
but neither will pigging out and spoiling yourself with luxury. You need to find 
that middle ground of self-esteem where you believe in yourself enough that you 
feel you do have the power to achieve your goals, but not esteem yourself so much 
that you inflate your sense of self and become egotistical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big take-away for me here is the middle path and how as a layperson I should 
follow it. A lot of my guilt comes from how seeking a partner is basically seeking 
sensual pleasure, but I've never thought about the &lt;em&gt;starving&lt;/em&gt; aspect of it before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find peace and happiness within first, then see if you can relate to others from 
that place of strength first. Otherwise you're just like a druggie looking for a fix, 
not a human being looking to express compassion or true love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/2psc9j/my_endless_struggle_with_unrequited_love/cmzpip8"&gt;Pain, and Self-Compassion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best reply in the thread, IMO, came from someone who was "gay and grew up really 
devout Mormon, so I was closeted until the age of 22".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think the purpose of Buddhist practice is to bring peace, per se. Peace 
is a biproduct of seeing clearly, and clear seeing and learning to stay with our 
emotions seems to me to be the purpose of Buddhist practice. One thing that helps 
me immensely is to see the relationships of close friends. All of them are filled 
with hard work, trials, and quite a bit of suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh god, yes. My rational half hates me for desiring something that I see is causing 
suffering for other people. It's like wanting to try Meth knowing full-well how bad 
it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took a long time for me to see that unrequited love lied to me. It told me 
that if only I could be with my roommate Adam, life would be perfect and beautiful, 
and I would be happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ultimate lie that love tries to sell us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what I also learned was that running away from the pain was not the answer. 
The pain of unrequited love itself contained its own solution. Meditating with the 
fundamental energy of it, I found an incredible tenderness in my pain. I realized 
that it came from years and years of living in the closet and rejecting myself, and 
that &lt;em&gt;the answer wasn't to find someone else to love me&lt;/em&gt;. It was to cultivate loving 
kindness and compassion for &lt;em&gt;myself&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't tried Metta meditation since I was in school, but I'll definitely give it 
a try after reading this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the deep pain still comes and goes--I'm not saying I've found a cure. The 
opposite. Buddhist practice has taught me that there is no cure. And that there's 
also no need for one :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm raw right now from a bit of a painful and sudden (like, this never happens... 
I felt like a teenager again) episode of obsessive affection for someone who 
doesn't even know I like her, and this thread helped me immensely. I hope it helps
you too.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="people"></category><category term="religion"></category><category term="sexuality"></category></entry><entry><title>Where The Lovers Have No Name</title><link href="https://janithl.github.io/2016/07/where-the-lovers-have-no-name/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-07-18T11:06:00+05:30</published><updated>2016-07-18T11:06:00+05:30</updated><author><name>Janith</name></author><id>tag:janithl.github.io,2016-07-18:/2016/07/where-the-lovers-have-no-name/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Camouflaged Love by Prasad Aluthwattha" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/best-art-ever.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturdays are spent at uni, and whenever I'm at uni I think of a 
&lt;a href="https://janithl.github.io/2016/07/shes-wot-m8.html"&gt;particular person&lt;/a&gt; who 
has nothing whatsoever to even do with uni. At one critical 3 hour paper last
semester, I spent maybe  one and a half hours desperately stuck in an alternate
reality in which we were more than just casual acquaintances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uni takes a heavy toll on my brain as well. Just today, within a couple of
minutes of each other, I had to  grapple with Hopfield Nets, Boltzmann Machines
(and energy functions and my old friend - Bayes' theorem), Convolutional Neural
Networks and their various stages of convolution and max pooling, and - in a 
totally unrelated class - flow networks, max-flow min-cut, to graph colouring 
and its many fascinating applications (all the way from scheduling to Sudoku). 
The only prior exposure I had to any of this was knowing that 4 colours are 
enough to colour any map, because I'm a &lt;em&gt;cartonerd&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, geekery isn't the only reason I &lt;em&gt;enjoy&lt;/em&gt; Saturdays. I get to speak to 3 
peers (who are older and wiser, so not really peers) who give me a fresh 
perspective on a lot of things. This week's installment was on dealing with 
bosses and criticism, and how you need to put your head down and accept things 
as they are and not pick fights. I listened, and pondered, but I don't really 
agree - being the socialist and troublemaker that I am. I think bosses need to 
be smarter at this whole game (and more diplomatic) than their charges, and 
maybe get rid of the whole boss/employee thing altogether and see each other 
as partners (like &lt;em&gt;that'll&lt;/em&gt; ever happen in our deeply hierarchical society).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, an observation my aforementioned peers made a few weeks ago, and I can 
anecdotally confirm because a lot of my batch-mates who graduated with me ended 
up so, is that a significant segment of female Sri Lankan graduates never work
in that field - or work at all. Even in a highly lucrative area like Software
Engineering. They end up married, and apparently that piece of paper is a 
prerequisite. IDK. So the next time someone asks you why there are so few 
female programmers...&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="uni"></category></entry><entry><title>Drift</title><link href="https://janithl.github.io/2016/07/drift/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-07-15T21:33:00+05:30</published><updated>2016-07-15T21:33:00+05:30</updated><author><name>Janith</name></author><id>tag:janithl.github.io,2016-07-15:/2016/07/drift/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Though I know I'll never lose affection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

interesting Medium posts. Highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A healthy product company is, confusingly, one at odds with itself. 
There is a healthy part which is attempting to normalize and to create 
predictability, and there needs to be another part that is tasked with 
building something new that is going to disrupt and eventually destroy 
that normality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failure to create some form of predictability will result in chaos. 
Failure to create some well-maintained Barbaric chaos inside the company 
guarantees that a fast-moving, ambitious, risk-taking and ruthless someone 
else — someone outside the company will invade because they know what you 
forgot: hacking is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@rands/hacking-is-important-ea632819d87c#.5sr0fxo71"&gt;'Hacking is Important'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve recently moved to a more “hip” location. We used to have personal 
desks, but now we have this “pick whatever spot is avaiable” open area. I 
dislike it a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

I picked up watching (the 7th season, which I've missed so far, of) Archer

lectures I have tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I inadvertently opined on some work-related matters (&lt;em&gt;bad me&lt;/em&gt;) because I ran 
into my co-workers yesterday and we engaged in a bit of shop-talk. Whoops. I
just pointed at an &lt;a href="https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html"&gt;old standard&lt;/a&gt; 
that I live by and hoped that it wasn't too intrusive of me to get involved. 
Again, &lt;em&gt;bad me&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Come on, dude. I've known you since we had other people wash our bums for us.
She's so not your type&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, we're grown-ups now. Shouldn't we look past "types" and all those
primitive constructs. I like her for who she is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Or you like her who who she makes you...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh, you know. Saves you from your eternal fear of ending up with a... simpleton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Look, you barely know her. In the past few days, from what I've seen, you've
been using that blank canvas to project your hopes and dreams&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dude. Too much truth on a Monday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;She's your ticket to legitimacy, the girl who reads, and knows, and speaks
well. She's funny, and beautiful, and you know she's going to be on the top of
the world one day. The ultimate Manic Pixie Dream Girl for nerds who actually
want them to be a bit less dreamy and a bit less manic...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I ain't sayin' I'm a gold digger, but I ain't messin' with no...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Look, all I'm saying is that she deserves better than to be blank canvas, or a 
trophy, no? She deserves to be her own woman, and you need to start seeing any 
person you'll be with as an equal, not as a stepping stone for your own...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zip it, Sherlock. I think they've all stopped reading at this point...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ah, it seems so.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="conversations"></category></entry><entry><title>Status Update</title><link href="https://janithl.github.io/2016/07/status-update/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-07-13T20:56:00+05:30</published><updated>2016-07-13T20:56:00+05:30</updated><author><name>Janith</name></author><id>tag:janithl.github.io,2016-07-13:/2016/07/status-update/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was watching &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlJnsHpWamU"&gt;one of the talks Casey Neistat gave at

Vidcon&lt;/a&gt; this year, and he talks
about his love for the 'act of creation', and how he loves his job just like  he
loves his family. The drive he has to wake up early to edit a video and put it
out, 365 days a year. It's crazy, and it makes me wish I had the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look, time for some straight talk, which I'm going to go into here because
nobody probably reads this (or knows it even exists). This &lt;em&gt;'sabbatical'&lt;/em&gt; was
going to be me getting down and slogging through a really difficult thesis, in
an area I barely understand (Natural Language Processing, Topic Detection and
Tracking, Temporal Text Mining etc.), and maybe rediscovering the spark, the
excitement that made me want to be a programmer all those years, and which
(along with a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_2mWhfOhGU"&gt;swelling Oasis
soundtrack&lt;/a&gt;) drove me to create
some really cool side-projects while at uni that ultimately landed me the sweet
gig of being a developer at my current place of employment. And three days in, I
can tell you that motivation is running real low and a huge part of me wants to
step back from the challenge and go back to the mundane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Masters', which I started in Jan 2015, has been harder on me than anything
I've done before. Before, when I was in school or uni, I had 7 days a week and
all of my mindspace to understand what I was being taught and properly digest
it. Contrary to what people expect from me, I'm not a fast learner. I'm slow and
take my time to experiment and truly grasp a concept, before becoming so
familiar and comfortable with it that I can run circles around everyone else
with my newfound toy. Getting thrown toys (and frankly amazing ones at that,
like R or NLTK) and having to balance them with the mundane work I do 9 - 5 on
weekdays has been like missing a WT20 finals because you need to water the
plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that's the situation as of now. The only driving force I have is this absurd
belief that, since I've finished everything I've &lt;em&gt;'passed'&lt;/em&gt; everything I've
started before, it'll be the same this time around as well. Let's hope lightning
does strike the same place repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="uni"></category><category term="oasis"></category><category term="work"></category><category term="casey neistat"></category></entry><entry><title>July</title><link href="https://janithl.github.io/2016/07/july/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-07-12T23:57:00+05:30</published><updated>2016-07-12T23:57:00+05:30</updated><author><name>Janith</name></author><id>tag:janithl.github.io,2016-07-12:/2016/07/july/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's July, I'm on a twelve week break from &lt;em&gt;jeewanopaya&lt;/em&gt;, it's
