pizza at home, something that I never thought I was capable of. Now, about 3 batches
of pizza later, I think I’ve got most of the big details sorted out. Credit also to
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_3v7DEkjsk"&gt;Andrew Rea for his pan pizza recipe&lt;/a&gt; which really helped me with kneading and
shaping techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prep time is about 3 hours, and I don’t do overnight refrigerator rises (I plan
to, one day, when I’m more patient and can remember to mix the dough the night before
I want the pizza)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Flour&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use the regular wheat flour, 150g per pizza. I usually make 3–4 pizzas so it’s
usually 450g or 600g. I don’t have a scale, so I use a measuring cup, sue me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Water, sugar and yeast&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first take 100ml of water, mix it with half a packet of dry yeast (about 7.5g),
and 2 tablespoons of sugar. Mix well and let it activate for at least 30 minutes
(but longer is better). This will foam up and overtop your container so make sure
you put it on a large enough jar or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hydration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m currently going for 60% hydration. This results in a very sticky dough but I
really like the taste and crunchy fluffiness of the final product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;60% hydration means you add 60% of your flour weight in water. For example if you
have 100g of flour, you add 60g (or 60ml–isn’t SI lovely!) of water. For 600g of
flour, this means adding 360ml of water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, &lt;strong&gt;remember that you already added 100ml to the yeast mixture&lt;/strong&gt;. So do make
sure to take that into account. You can just top up the yeast mixture with 260ml
of water and add the whole shebang to the flour in a large mixing bowl. Add a
tablespoon of salt and two tablespoons of olive oil (I usually substitute with
&lt;em&gt;pol thel&lt;/em&gt; because I am not made out of money).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mix, mix, mix. You can check &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1O3uHPCOLA"&gt;Babish for ways to knead without breaking your back&lt;/a&gt;.
I used to knead with my hands, but now I just use the mixer attachment in my
immersion blender and small bursts to get the thing kneaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let it rest for 2 hours with a wet cloth on top of the bowl. This step is called
the &lt;strong&gt;bulk ferment&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Shaping&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After letting your dough rise, break it into 3 or 4 parts. I really eyeball this and
don’t really care about accuracy at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the tricky part of actual shaping. The dough is sticky af and will stick to
anything, and I am currently experimenting with oil paper sheets cut into circles,
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZEGG1mb3Rc"&gt;like what Adam Ragusea does sometimes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You drop the dough balls into a bowl of flour, and dust your fingers with flour as
well. Drop the balls onto the oil paper and taking care not to deflate the edge (cornice)
use your fingers to push down and flatten the middle. Doing this and expanding the
pizza to your required size is the least fun part of the whole process for me, and I
have not perfected it at all. After you’re done making a fool of yourself, let it rest
and rise for another 1 hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sauce&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now is a good time to get started on the sauce. I just chop up one onion (or two), and
smash a clove or two of garlic. I mix in about 2 tomatoes per pizza, so for 4 you’d need
8 tomatoes. It’s a good idea to drop the tomatoes in a hot water bath and peel off the
skins if that’s your thing. People also remove the seeds. I do neither of these things
because I am lazy and I don’t want to throw stuff away. Drop everything into a pan (onions
and garlic first) with oil, add water and tomato sauce as desired, and mix well over
medium heat. Once it looks good season with salt and pepper, and then put everything in a
jar and use an immersion blender to mix it all in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cheese&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get pre-shredded motz. Shred your own motz. American YouTubers swear by adjectives
(“low moisture”, “full fat”), but we don’t really have much variety here right? Get whatever
mozzarella you can and just shred it into a bowl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other toppings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve tried olives, sausages, and bacon. They all work well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Baking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pre-heat your oven to 200°C. Apply the sauce first, then the cheese, then drop any other
toppings. Brush your crust with some oil if you want things to look fancy. Slide your oil
paper’d pizza onto a baking pan to bake&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Your cook time will depend on your oven and
other factors I guess, but for me it’s usually between 15–20 minutes. I know it’s done when
the toppings are getting burnt and the crust starts looking brown (if the crust is still
white I’d advice keeping it in for a bit more). The oil paper should come right off now that
the pizza is baked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep experimenting, and I’m sure you’ll find better ways of doing things. For example if
you want a more burnt bottom you can try a small trick I do and use a &lt;em&gt;roti pan&lt;/em&gt; on the
stove to burn the bottom (this can happen before you put it in the oven).&lt;/p&gt;

a pretty common sense argument and there are many historial examples that are often
held up, one of the most popular being the rise of the Nazi party in the liberal
democracy of the Weimar Republic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A problem that I've see cropping up recently (first in online communities, but soon
evolving to have offline consequences) is with the &lt;em&gt;definition of intolerance&lt;/em&gt;—and
the actions the self-proclaimed ‘defenders’ of tolerance take to guard it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example from a few years back was the &lt;em&gt;Sinha-le&lt;/em&gt; stickers, and the &lt;em&gt;Colombo liberal&lt;/em&gt;
reaction to it. Without even considering the origins of the sticker campaign, or
motivations of those who chose to brand their vehicles with said sticker, a counter-campaign
was launched to take photographs, identify owners of the vehicles, and basically notify
their employees (with the ultimate intention of getting them fired, of course). Now, the
obvious moral issues of doxxing aside, this was one of the first instances I observed
the troubling phenomenon of online vigilantism, and what later came to be known as
&lt;em&gt;cancel culture&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, many years later, cancel culture seems to be here to stay. It has led to a situation
which I’ve only experienced previously due to the looming threat of violence from a repressive
surveillance state: &lt;em&gt;self-censorship&lt;/em&gt;. Netizens, people who used to risk their necks to
speak out against injustice being perpetrated by nation states, were now treating certain
subjects as off-limits, lest they be branded &lt;em&gt;“-phobes”&lt;/em&gt; and cancelled. It is truly an
unexpected low-intensity reign of terror, and unlike state actors where there might be
&lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; legal recourse/FR petition/habeas corpus/international pressure to give you at
least an iota of relief, in this case mobs accountable to no one and run by shadowy teenagers
seem to mete out justice after kangaroo trials. It sort of feels like the &lt;em&gt;JVP days&lt;/em&gt; are here
again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what’s a society to do to emerge out of this mess and reclaim our right to discourse and
divergent viewpoints? I honestly don’t know, but remember that an insurgency can only survive
as long as the wider populace supports it. For far too long we’ve allowed &lt;em&gt;important online public spaces&lt;/em&gt;
to be run by social media firms milking our emotions for ad revenue. They have, in turn, given
us skewed elections, body image issues, FOMO, and free reign for online bullies. This fight is
well and truly lost, &lt;strong&gt;unless&lt;/strong&gt; we take back our spaces. We will need to demand that the firms
for whom we create so much value give us—the community—the tools to curate, moderate, and monitor
those spaces&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. We will need tougher regulations while guaranteeing freedom of expression, a tough
balancing act whenever governments (especially in our little corner of the world) get involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, an even more pressing need will be for us as a society to come to terms with what
&lt;strong&gt;is and isn’t intolerant speech&lt;/strong&gt;. We will have to grow up and tolerate dissenting views, and
not call for heads to roll whenever viewpoints that make us clutch our pearls come up on our feeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to believe technology could help alleviate societal problems, but I now realise that
technology is merely a &lt;em&gt;megaphone&lt;/em&gt;—the voice and the words that come out of it will ultimately always
be &lt;em&gt;your own&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would talk about solutions like &lt;a href="https://joinmastodon.org"&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;, but I really think that the convenience and network effect of, say, Facebook’s multi-network empire will take decades to dismantle.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

yesterday. This is &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3621843372"&gt;my short review&lt;/a&gt; that I added on Goodreads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it's a bit harsh to rate this book using modern standards when it was
written in the 1940s. Yes, it's not as fast paced or as expansive as modern SciFi,
and there is a woeful lack of female characters (only one gets a speaking part).
But modern SciFi didn't exist when Asimov wrote this, and so much of it even to
this day draws from the vein Asimov struck (the parallels with the Star Wars universe
a few decades later is notable, for example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, it might be a good idea to look at where Asimov himself drew inspiration
from: Edward Gibbon's &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_History_of_the_Decline_and_Fall_of_the_Roman_Empire"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
Basically, we can class the work as a &lt;em&gt;space history&lt;/em&gt;, concerning how vast empires
decay, how the people living in the midst of such empires experience this fall much
more differently than the people living in the peripheries, and how opportunists
come for the scraps. One wonders how Asimov predicted so well the work of the oligarchs
and pocket dictators after the fall of his native Soviet Union, and fifty years before
the fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I found strikingly modern though are its takes on religion as a means of social
control, ivory tower academics who were unconcerned with all but dogma while the Rome
that sustained their work burned around them, and how societies tend to reject
science and technology it doesn't understand-a theme that reverberates well in
today's post-Covid world.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="conflict"></category><category term="people"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>Links: What I've Been Watching</title><link href="https://janithl.github.io/2020/10/links-what-ive-been-watching/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-10-23T21:38:00+05:30</published><updated>2020-10-23T21:38:00+05:30</updated><author><name>Janith</name></author><id>tag:janithl.github.io,2020-10-23:/2020/10/links-what-ive-been-watching/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here's a small recap of what I've been watching on the ol' YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's been a crazy year, and this is the fourth draft of a post that I've
been writing since the middle of August. Just like the music and paintings
I've been working on, I kept hitting a wall where what I wanted to say, and
what I was capable of saying diverged. I'm just tired at this point. I've
tried to be proactive in a year in which that sort of thing just wasn't
meant to be. Talk about a bad &lt;em&gt;nekatha&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now, I prefer to keep strings like this in a separate file in React Native, to make
the frequent requests for text changes contained to a single file. But a complex
template string like this was impossible to store that way, until...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Enter Tagged Template Literals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.taniarascia.com/understanding-template-literals/"&gt;This post by Tania Rascia&lt;/a&gt; opened my eyes to the power of &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals"&gt;Tagged Template Literals&lt;/a&gt;
in JS. Seeing this example blew my mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;bold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;strings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;expressions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;finalString&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Loop through all expressions&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;expressions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;finalString&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;strings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sb"&gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sb"&gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Add the last string literal&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;finalString&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;strings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;strings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;finalString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kr"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;bold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sb"&gt;`This is a string with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sb"&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sb"&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sb"&gt; interpolated inside.`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Okay, with a quick few tweaks we can definitely apply this to React Native, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Highlighting Text in React Native&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;const highlightText = (baseStyle, highlightStyle) =&amp;gt; (strings, ...values) =&amp;gt; (
  &amp;lt;Text style={baseStyle}&amp;gt;
    {strings.map((string, index) =&amp;gt; (
      &amp;lt;&amp;gt;
        {string}
        &amp;lt;Text style={highlightStyle}&amp;gt;
          {values[index]}
        &amp;lt;/Text&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/&amp;gt;
    ))}
  &amp;lt;/Text&amp;gt;
);
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Note I am using a higher order function so that I can pass in custom styles. We can also
pass in other stuff like entire components, if that is the requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we could store the Tagged Template Literal and use it wherever in our JSX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;const action = &amp;quot;send a message&amp;quot;;
const user = &amp;quot;Pingpong&amp;quot;;
const description = highlightText(
  styles.text,
  styles.highlight
)`You’re going to ${action} to ${user}. Please confirm?`;

// in the render method
&amp;lt;Text&amp;gt;{description}&amp;lt;/Text&amp;gt;;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Aaand, we're done! 🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; Many of you will rightly wonder if &lt;code&gt;action&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;user&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;styles&lt;/code&gt; will need
to be defined in the same file as the Template Literal. No, we can simply make it a
function and pass these values direct from the component, like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;const description = (user, action, styles) =&amp;gt; highlightText(
  styles.text,
  styles.highlight
)`You’re going to ${action} to ${user}. Please confirm?`;

// in the render method
&amp;lt;Text&amp;gt;{description(&amp;#39;Pingpong&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Send a message&amp;#39;, styles)}&amp;lt;/Text&amp;gt;;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Stack&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app is written in React Native (currently version 0.62). There is no navigation
library in use, as the app only needs some modals in the UI at the moment. The editor
uses &lt;a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg"&gt;react-native-svg&lt;/a&gt; to render the flags. &lt;a href="https://github.com/joltup/rn-fetch-blob"&gt;rn-fetch-blob&lt;/a&gt; is used to save
the various output files (as a PNG raster or SVG vector inside an HTML) to device storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;State Management&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State is managed using a &lt;a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer"&gt;single &lt;code&gt;useReducer&lt;/code&gt; hook&lt;/a&gt; near the root of the component
tree. The store is currently divided into 3 parts with their own reducer functions:
flag, ui, and charges. I found this approach had most of the advantages of Redux (since
the component tree was shallow and I didn't need to use the Context API) when it came to
composing the state and reducers. I use two &lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt; hooks to store the state in
device storage&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; whenever it changes, and load it from storage at app start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Components&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is your standard &lt;code&gt;Header&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Footer&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Menu&lt;/code&gt; etc. components, and a bunch
of &lt;code&gt;renderSomething&lt;/code&gt; components that render either charges or divisions. Most of the
action happens inside the &lt;code&gt;Editor&lt;/code&gt; component, and we're using SVG—a fantastic language
that really should get more love—for the design and layout of shapes and designs. I
used a bunch of SVG features such as &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Patterns"&gt;patterns&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/transform"&gt;transform&lt;/a&gt; to enable various
rendering needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Finally&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/janithl/Flagitect"&gt;Flagitect is completely free and open source (MIT licensed)&lt;/a&gt;, and I'd love for
people using it to submit issues and PRs, or even fork it and make things better. I
found that Google Play was lacking when it came to flag design apps, and so I created
Flagitect in the hope that amateur vexillologists like myself would find it useful. ☺️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Krita piece took all day to finish, and could still do with more polish... but
I'm sleepy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also appending my review on Goodreads here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been fascinated with Sri Lanka in the 80s. It was, in my reading, a bookend
in history, ending the bell-bottomed idealism 60s and 70s, and dawning Sri Lanka into
the horrors of war and insurrection... a history that would grow even more violent
well into the 90s and 00s. What little scraps I could find of its written history
I would mop up, because these things were never taught at school and never discussed
by the elders (who'd much rather forget).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Maali (and his privileged set of friends) is the canvas through which we explore
this reality, it is really a story of all that we lost; the young family that mourns
their murdered university lecturer/human rights advocate mother, the families that
left everything behind and ran-and still didn't make it, the thousands of kids who
disappeared overnight because their political leanings were suspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chats with the Dead is a start of a conversation that Sri Lanka has to have regarding
its past. It has been 30+ years since the brutal end of the Second JVP Insurrection,
and books like these and films like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paangshu"&gt;Visakesa Chandrasekaram's Paangshu&lt;/a&gt; serve as
an important bridge that passes on these lessons (and the fact that justice was never
done) to a younger generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. I have been a fan of Shehan's since Chinaman, and I think this is a worthy
successor. Other than touching on conflict and race relations though, I think the
books have little in common, and that's a good thing. Chats with the Dead should be
judged on its own merits as a standalone book.&lt;/p&gt;

perched on the rooftop balcony overlooking the suburbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You smoke?", she asked pointing the pack at him. Toying momentarily with the
idea of changing his entire personality to fit in (as he often does), he
finally resigned to a quiet "no, thanks". He hoped it didn't come out as some
sort of value judgement, but she had moved on to flicking the Bic lighter and
trying to keep the flame alive, paying no attention to the drama in his head.
She took two drags as the embers matched the colour of the setting sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Don't you feel like we've fallen short?", she asked as the street below
slowly filled up with the occupants of their office building leaving for
their homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I guess we have. I guess this isn't what our parents had in mind."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She took a look at her toes as she took another drag, and silence descended
on them. He didn't really mind silences, but he also didn't have a rapport
with her yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"No plans to hop on a boat?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Not at least until I'm done with college, no. And even then, I quite like it
here."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ah yes, the comfortable prison of the familiar and the known", he thought—and
wisely kept to himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"And you? Big shot computer man? Can't you earn way more over there?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He could, he said. Maybe next year. It's the lie he told all his relatives,
being as much a prisoner as she was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a chance meeting that happened because of a dare, this evening was going
pretty well, he thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="text-center text-muted"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Machang you always give talk but you &lt;em&gt;never. follow. through.&lt;/em&gt; Always close.
Always no cigar."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Don't harass him, he's clearly still not over you know who."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What nonsense men, I'm perfectly over her"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Prove it"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Come on, I'm not 15 any more no?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you ask her out I will quit ciggies for a month."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Pinky promise. See? I'm not hung up about how adult I am."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="text-center text-muted"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was honestly the weirdest couple of minutes of his life. A diehard introvert
who was just short of wearing "INFP" in bold lettering on his t-shirt every day
(and that too for fear of attracting too much attention—much preferring
monochromatic clothes), he barged into her office and asked if it was the meeting
room, knowing fully well from his 2 years working in this building that it wasn't.
She said that it wasn't, and in her usual cheery and helpful manner assisted him
to find his 'intended' destination on the other side of the floor. He thanked her
and they exchanged names. Three days later, and a couple of 'totally unexpected'
moments bumping into each other on elevators and stairwells, they were on this
rooftop sharing tobacco smoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They should have Google Calendars for the meeting rooms."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Oh yeah, that would sort a lot of the messes out", he replied, and he knew what
the next line was going to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You guys would block out most of it anyway".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looked apologetic, and then they both laughed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They should also maybe add floor maps so people don't get lost...". Her lips were
curling into a mischievous smile, and her deep brown eyes glistened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ye... yeah they should."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I mean, three days ago I saw a man I've seen use the second floor meeting room at
least half a dozen times suddenly lose his bearings and walk into an office on the
other side of the building." She was pointedly avoiding your gaze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I..."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She took another drag, and smoke escaped her smiling teeth as she looked over the
coconut tree tops turning orange red with the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You really sure you don't want a smoke?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just finished reading &lt;a href="https://penguin.co.in/book/uncategorized/chats-with-the-dead/"&gt;'Chats with the Dead'&lt;/a&gt; and it was incredible and I

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, you need to make up your mind.&lt;/strong&gt; If you take this project on you &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt;
proactively try to make things better. How to do this will depend on a number of
factors and the support of the stakeholders, but you must &lt;em&gt;actively try&lt;/em&gt; to make
the codebase a &lt;em&gt;better place&lt;/em&gt;, or you'd come to the end of your 2 or whatever
years looking after this garbage dump and not have anything good to show for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand the system.&lt;/strong&gt; Learning the codebase might take time, but try to
figure out what the overarching concepts, the business logic, and what users
actually want to achieve. What users &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to do with the system and what the
system &lt;em&gt;currently does&lt;/em&gt; might be misaligned, so porting the thing with warts
and all into a shiny new shell might not make sense. Use that misalignment, make
it a chance to drive a wedge between the client and his software, and...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try to get the stakeholders onboard.&lt;/strong&gt; Try to make a point about how the
shittiness of the current system is costing them customers and money. Businesses
usually care about reputation and the bottom line, so you have to make your case
in lingo they understand. Show them the numbers, show them how it could all be
better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Break down the system into parts.&lt;/strong&gt; Moving everything wholesale into the new
system is not going to be practical in most cases. See where you can start
porting right now, and get to work. Things that could be services&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; on their
own, like reporting, exports, and external integrations, are good places to
start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write tests.&lt;/strong&gt; If I could go back in time and teach my older self anything,
it's the value of writing tests first before getting down to implementations.
This one thing will make your code more reliable and add value. In the case of
a rewrite, this is even more straightforward: the user journeys are already
concrete and you can easily write test cases for them to guide the new
implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get your team excited.&lt;/strong&gt; This has gone on long enough and I know you guys are
fatigued, but we can work together and make life less shit for ourselves and
our users. Try to understand their concerns and misgivings, but also don't
compromise in your quest to &lt;em&gt;make the world a better place&lt;/em&gt;. They'll thank you
later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="text-center text-muted"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always learn these lessons too late, when the chance for me to &lt;em&gt;act&lt;/em&gt; on
them has already passed. But hey, maybe it'll come in handy someday.&lt;/p&gt;

reduction in bus rides after the Easter Attacks in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Bus journeys by month" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/bus-journeys-by-month.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After April, I switched to tuks as my primary mode of commuting to work in the
morning, only taking the bus in the evening during my commute home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While initially driven by post-Easter attack paranoia, environmental factors have
also been a concern especially with the increase in average temperatures. Although
still a firm believer in public transport, I no longer wanted to turn up at work a
sweaty mess. Let's hope A/C buses start rolling out on the 138 route soon&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. 🙏🏽&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the ride counts and average fares for 2019 in comparison to 2018:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;th align="right"&gt;Avg (2019)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align="right"&gt;Count Diff&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;td align="right"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-180&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huh, never realised I'd taken 180 less journeys in total this year. Must be all the
sleeping in on weekends. 🙈&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other Expenses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've bought food 247 times in 2019, up from 200 times in 2018. The average order
value has gone up slightly, from 572 LKR to 600 LKR. I've bought clothing 4 times,
up from just 2 times in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've made 16 purchases on AliExpress this year, up from 5 purchases last year. The
average order value has stayed roughly the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Social Media&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been on a bit of a hiatus from Twitter and Instagram, with only 6
images posted on my IG this year (and none since June). But I did start
&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/chithrapotha/"&gt;an Instagram purely for my illustrations&lt;/a&gt; and I've managed to post about 29
posts in the space of a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Chithrapotha" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/chithrapotha.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing more and putting it out there is a goal that I want to work towards
in 2020. I've also uploaded 18 song snippets to my SoundCloud, and plan to upload
longer and more developed pieces in 2020 (fingers crossed!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="text-center text-muted"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, those are some of my stats for the year. How has 2019 been for you
and how do you plan to spend your 2020?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
window.onload = function() {
   $('table').addClass('table table-bordered table-condensed'); 
}
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up from 153 in 2018.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still don't have an Uber account, and don't plan on getting one.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And eventually we can all take the Kelani Valley railway, which is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nuuuwan/status/1203260223378604033"&gt;currently incredibly under-utilised&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="text-center"&gt;Yes, but can Liberals batter down doors anymore?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night, dealing with a bought of insomnia, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/29/lesson-in-boris-johnson-jolliness-liberal-miserabilsm-is-a-turn-off"&gt;I read this important take on BoJo&lt;/a&gt;
(not to be confused with BoJack) and the conservative wave sweeping across not just the
UK but most of the world. While there might be a few points of contention, I think
overall it was a good state of the union on liberalism and what I like to think is a
bit of a disease among educated liberals: the refusal and lack of confidence in pushing
our agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="text-center text-muted"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Born at the tail end of the Berlin Wall and the Soviet Union, my generation was very
liberal and expected the generations that followed us to be even more so. The online
communities where we came of age were incredibly inclusive, liberal, and &lt;em&gt;"woke"&lt;/em&gt;. And
yet, woke culture itself overextended and exposed the flanks, leading to the almost
&lt;em&gt;unthinkable&lt;/em&gt; scenario of an incredibly right-leaning younger generation, and the liberal
and free thinking communities of our youth turned to the right as a reaction to the
seeming &lt;em&gt;authoritarianism of the new left&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;yoofs&lt;/em&gt; were also very much multiculturally aware, having grown up with access to
different &lt;em&gt;lived experiences&lt;/em&gt; via the internet, and very much sensitive to what it saw as
liberal intolerances of differing opinions, as well as seeming mollycoddling of the more
bigoted minorities within minorities. To the kids growing up on Gangam Style, it was no
longer western values at stake but an overarching global value structure&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which was
threatened not by the traditional scapegoat of crusty and rich old conservatives&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but
by increasingly intolerant, tone deaf, preachy ivory tower PC liberals.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="text-center text-muted"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short: Even though there is a lot of hope left in the world and its youth (in
the form of e.g. Greta Thunberg, CAA protestors in Indian universities, and the younger
remain voters at the Brexit polls), it is still disheartening to see some in such an educated
and informed generation turn towards reactionism over progressivism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the libs, it is time to regroup and look inward. We must reflect on the past decade, the
victories (MARRIAGE EQUALITY!) and the bitter defeats, and consider what we value the most,
what our core inviolable principles are. Lines might have to be drawn where our usual support
for personal preferences and freedoms infringe on the rights of the other and the collective&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
It is time to raise those voices in battle cries, as the rich keep becoming richer, and use
their money and influence to sow division among the working man to further their own ends. We
don't have much time—the greed of our race has set the planet on fire. The rich will burrow
underneath and survive, but what of us poor proles? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="text-center text-muted"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is time to step away from books and back into society. It's time to make welfare great again,
fight for unionisation and the rights of the worker and the downtrodden. Come to the understanding
that humanity isn't perfect, but that we must struggle to make this planet and our society better,
more equitable and more inclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's time to bring back civil discourse, please, and thank you. No one likes being talked down to,
or being called racist because they were simply well-meaning but ignorant. Bring back the humanity,
bring back the fight, bring back Travellers on the Discovery Channel. Shout from the rooftops
&lt;em&gt;how awesome science is&lt;/em&gt;, and how excited we are about exploring outer space, reforesting our
planet, or curing disease. Stand against bigotry, while also acknowledging that bigotry is bigotry
regardless of the source. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3U6rRK9ul0"&gt;As the great Imtiaz Bakeer Markar once said&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think not in terms of &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; is right and who is wrong, but &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; is right and what is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would argue this dates back to enlightenment thinking and classical liberalism.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still very much the actual villain—see Prince Andrew.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally do not believe it is a zero sum game. Living in a republic is based on a
social contract, and some individualistic excesses might have to be forgone in the service of cohesion.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

නොම්බරේ ලබාගන්න එකයි කරන්න. හැම සයිට් එකකටම අලුත් parser එකක් අපි පාවිච්චි
කරනව. Parser එකේ තව මෙත​ඩ් දෙකකුත් තියෙනව: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;getSiteVersion()&lt;/code&gt; එක ලූප් එකක් ඇතුළෙ කෝල් වෙනව. ඒකෙන් අලුත් Parser එකක් හැදිල,
පේජ් එකේ අන්තර්ගතය අරන්, version නොම්බරේ හොයාගෙන, ඔක්කොටම ගතවෙච්ච කාලෙත්
සටහන් කරගන්නව. මේකෙ &lt;a href="https://gobyexample.com/mutexes"&gt;mutex&lt;/a&gt; එකක් අපි පාවිච්චි කරන්නෙ නෑ මොකෝ &lt;code&gt;sites&lt;/code&gt; slice
එක පාවිච්චි කරද්දි හැම slice element එකම කියවන්නෙයි ලියන්නෙයි ඒකට අදාල Goroutine
එකෙන් විතරක් නිසා. එහෙම නොවුනනම් අනිවා mutex එකක් පාවිච්චි කරන්න වෙනව.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; එකේ &lt;code&gt;done&lt;/code&gt; කියල channel එකක් අපි පාවිච්චි කරනව. ඒ program එක ඉවර කරන්න
කලිං ඔක්කොම Goroutines ටික වැඩ ඉවරයි නේද කියල චෙක් කරන්න. මේ වෙනුවට
&lt;a href="https://gobyexample.com/waitgroups"&gt;WaitGroup&lt;/a&gt; එකක් පාවිච්චි කරන්නත් පුලුවන්. අන්තිමට අපි &lt;code&gt;sites&lt;/code&gt; slice එක JSON එකක්
විදිහට එළියට දානව.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;රස්සාව &lt;s&gt;වෙලා​වෙ&lt;/s&gt; වෙනුවෙන් ලියපු එකම Go කෝඩ් කෑල්ල මේක තමයි. තව ලියන්න
තිබ්බ නං කියල හිතෙනව, එච්චරට language එක ලස්සනයි. මේ වගේ systems වැඩ කරන්න
එහෙම කියාපු language එක.&lt;/p&gt;

අවුලක් වෙන්න පුළුවන්, මොකෝ known bugs පාවිච්චි කරල හැකර් අයියල සයිට් එකට

&lt;p&gt;My current work requires keeping track of more than a dozen live websites and
making sure that their versions are kept up to date. We have employed a small Go
program to make this possible, which enable us to scrape the generator meta tags
on the websites and thereby get the version number&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code is simple and uses Goroutines to let us concurrently connect to the sites.
The code we use in prod is a bit more specialised, but I've reproduced a version
that captures the essentials below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;encoding/json&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;io/ioutil&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;net/http&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;os&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;regexp&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;time&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Site type holds information about sites&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Site&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;TimeTaken&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sites&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Site&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Site A&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;https://a.web.site&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;N/A&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Site B&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;https://b.web.site&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;N/A&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Site C&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;https://c.web.site&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;N/A&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Parser type holds information about the parsing&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Parser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Parser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Site&lt;/code&gt; is simply a struct that holds info about the particular site, and fields
to capture the version and the time taken to do the scrape&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've initialised a slice of sites with the URLs we need to scrape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Parser&lt;/code&gt; simply encapsulates parsing behaviour, and has two more methods,
reproduced below. For each scrape, we initialise a new parser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Parser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getMatches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;regexString&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;regex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;regexp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Compile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;regexString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;matches&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;regex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;FindStringSubmatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;matches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;matches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;N/A&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Parser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getVersion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Fetch Error&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ioutil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ReadAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Parse Error&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getMatches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;(&amp;lt;meta name=\&amp;quot;generator\&amp;quot; content=\&amp;quot;)([^\&amp;quot;]+)&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;getVersion()&lt;/code&gt; simply gets and reads the page body, and &lt;code&gt;getMatches()&lt;/code&gt; is a method
to try and match the generator tag regex and return the value of the tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we get to the main function and the &lt;code&gt;getSiteVersion()&lt;/code&gt; goroutine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getSiteVersion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;chan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;start&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// to check the time taken&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;site&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Parser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;site&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sites&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sites&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Version&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;site&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getVersion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sites&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;TimeTaken&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Since&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;make&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;chan&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sites&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;go&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getSiteVersion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sites&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;enc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;NewEncoder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Stdout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;enc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Encode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sites&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;getSiteVersion()&lt;/code&gt; gets called in a loop, initialises the Parser, does the scrape,
and does simple time keeping of how long a scrape takes. We don't use a &lt;a href="https://gobyexample.com/mutexes"&gt;mutex&lt;/a&gt;
when accessing the &lt;code&gt;sites&lt;/code&gt; slice here because each element is only accessed by one
Goroutine, but if this was not the case a mutex would be essential here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt;, we're simply using a channel called &lt;code&gt;done&lt;/code&gt; to make sure all the
Goroutines are done executing before we quit the application, and as a final step
we output the &lt;code&gt;sites&lt;/code&gt; slice as JSON. As an alternative, a &lt;a href="https://gobyexample.com/waitgroups"&gt;WaitGroup&lt;/a&gt; can be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is sadly the only piece of Go code I have written &lt;s&gt;at&lt;/s&gt; for work, but it does
its job admirably, and I would highly recommend Go for tasks like these.&lt;/p&gt;

So that leaves me at my most comfortable—a good old conversation

&lt;p&gt;There is beauty in solitude. You only truly begin to appreciate it
as you get older. At long last you feel validated that the things
you felt growing up as a shy and introverted only-child have real
world applications!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Society doesn't feel this way about solitude. It sees the uncoupled
male as some sort of threat that has to be neutralised at all cost.
The same relatives who threatened to box your ears if you so much
as looked in the direction of the opposite sex now expect you to bed
a complete stranger. South Asian families are whack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it's just so very amazing to be on your own and really
appreciate it. Like how you appreciate your head ceasing to spin
after a really heavy night of drinking. You just sit there being
thankful for the ordinary, the sober. And that's beautiful, isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;

Well, the tab arrived in the mail today, and I want to share some of my experiments on
my first day of digital art!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="First Drawing" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/sketches/digital-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Second Drawing" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/sketches/digital-2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first few attempts (above) were predictably terrible, but I began realising that my
usual &lt;a href="https://janithl.github.io/2019/11/ive-been-sketching/"&gt;sketching&lt;/a&gt; and watercolouring techniques weren't the best match for the medium,
because digital was something else entirely! As I told Dili, "it's like working with clay,
I can mould this shit all day". And that was my lightbulb moment, the fact that I can
mould the light and shadows to create shapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Digital Drawing" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/sketches/digital-3.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's been a lot of fun, and this next piece took only 45 minutes. Having an undo button,
an eraser, and all the brushes in the world&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is definitely expanding the possibilities
for my limited artistic ability. It's like giving FL Studio to a kid who wants to write
music but can't play an instrument&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; After a few more days (actually 3 days, because of travel) of playing with the

&lt;em&gt;Orange Guy&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Fail Girl&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://janithl.github.io/2019/10/react-clean-architecture-part-1/"&gt;In the last part&lt;/a&gt;, we broke the application core out, with layers for

part (without breaking the core out) can be found on Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let's look at how we can implement the core. I will be using …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Core Folder Structure" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/clean-arch-folders.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://janithl.github.io/2019/10/react-clean-architecture-part-1/"&gt;In the last part&lt;/a&gt;, we broke the application core out, with layers for

part (without breaking the core out) can be found on Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let's look at how we can implement the core. I will be using TypeScript
here because it has two things that we will make implementing Clean Architecture
much easier: types, and interfaces. &lt;a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-React-Conversion-Guide"&gt;To add TypeScript to an existing React
project&lt;/a&gt;, we can simply run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;yarn add -D typescript awesome-typescript-loader source-map-loader
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Entities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To separate out the core code from the rest of the app, so we'll first create a
subfolder called &lt;code&gt;core&lt;/code&gt;, with three subfolders for the Entity, Use Case, and
Infra layers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;src/core
├── entities
├── infrastructure
└── usecases
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Inside the &lt;code&gt;entities&lt;/code&gt; subfolder, we'll first create the &lt;code&gt;Item&lt;/code&gt; class which holds
Item entities. This is a domain entity that will be used throughout the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="kt"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="kt"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kr"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="kt"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="kt"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We will also create an &lt;code&gt;ItemRepository&lt;/code&gt; interface that will enable us to abstract
out the API calls (and maybe local storage caching later on) which actually get
us the items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;./Item&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kr"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ItemRepository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;GetItems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Note how it is returning a Promise (with a list of Items), as it will be an async
operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Use Cases&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, we implement the &lt;code&gt;UserService&lt;/code&gt;. We are implementing the service after defining
an interface because this will make writing tests etc. easier. There are arguments
against single implementation interfaces, but that is a debate for another time. The
service simply gets the items from the repository and returns them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;../entities/Item&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kr"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ItemRepository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;../entities/ItemRepository&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kr"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ItemService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;GetItems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kr"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ItemServiceImpl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ItemService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;itemRepo&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="kt"&gt;ItemRepository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kr"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ir&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="kt"&gt;ItemRepository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;itemRepo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;GetItems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;itemRepo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;GetItems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Notice how the constructor of the service takes an item repository. This is the runtime
injection of dependencies that makes this &lt;strong&gt;super exciting&lt;/strong&gt;. We can swap implementations
at runtime and the service has no hard dependencies on &lt;code&gt;infrastructure&lt;/code&gt; code, instead
relying on an interface defined at the &lt;code&gt;entity&lt;/code&gt; layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we implement the &lt;code&gt;UserRepository&lt;/code&gt; we defined in the &lt;code&gt;entity&lt;/code&gt; layer. It will
just be a simple API call using &lt;code&gt;fetch()&lt;/code&gt;. We should add error handling here, but I've
left it out for now for the sake of simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;../entities/Item&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kr"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ItemRepository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;../entities/ItemRepository&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kr"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ItemDTO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="kt"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="kt"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kr"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ItemRepositoryImpl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ItemRepository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;jsonUrl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;...&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;GetItems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kr"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;jsonUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kr"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;jsonData&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;jsonData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="kt"&gt;ItemDTO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Note how we are defining an &lt;code&gt;ItemDTO&lt;/code&gt; here. This is your contract with the API, and will
change with time. The following line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;jsonData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="kt"&gt;ItemDTO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;is also very important. This is where the DTO is being mapped to a domain entity. We
can move this transformation to another file as our implementation grows in complexity,
as this code is on an architectural boundary and will change quite frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;All Together Now&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can now edit our Thunk to use the service instead of directly calling the API:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;LIST_LOAD_REQUEST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;LIST_LOAD_SUCCESS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;LIST_LOAD_FAILURE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;./Item.types&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kr"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ItemServiceImpl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;../core/usecases/ItemService&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kr"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ItemRepositoryImpl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;../core/infrastructure/ItemRepositoryImpl&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kr"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;refreshList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dispatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dispatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;LIST_LOAD_REQUEST&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kr"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;itemRepo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ItemRepositoryImpl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kr"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;itemService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ItemServiceImpl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;itemRepo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kr"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;itemService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;GetItems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dispatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;LIST_LOAD_SUCCESS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;payload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dispatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;LIST_LOAD_FAILURE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The first three lines within the try hold the essence of any dependency injection setup:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;itemRepo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ItemRepositoryImpl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;First, we initalise the repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;itemService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ItemServiceImpl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;itemRepo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then, we inject it into the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;itemService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;GetItems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And finally, we access the methods offered by the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's good to keep these steps explicitly defined, so that the flow is clear and can
be changed in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's it! We've taken our core out and implemented it in a completely isolated
fashion that doesn't depend on infrastructure concerns. This makes things nice and
testable (I'll try to add some tests to the repo soon!), and makes you think about
the parts of your code that can (and definitely will) change—and how to make sure
that change is contained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the reason we do not put SQL in JSPs. This is the reason we do not generate
HTML in the modules that compute results. This is the reason that business rules
should not know the database schema. This is the reason we separate concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another wording for the Single Responsibility Principle is: "Gather together the
things that change for the same reasons. Separate those things that change for
different reasons."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think about this you’ll realize that this is just another way to define
cohesion and coupling. We want to increase the cohesion between things that change
for the same reasons, and we want to decrease the coupling between those things
that change for different reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="text-center"&gt;Clean Architecture, simplified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm a huge fan of Robert C. Martin's work in general, and &lt;a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html"&gt;Clean Architecture&lt;/a&gt; in
particular. I'm frequently on the lookout for how to apply it to the different system
architectures and frameworks we work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which modules should be decoupled? I think the rule is similar …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Clean Architecture" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/clean-arch-diagram.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="text-center"&gt;Clean Architecture, simplified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm a huge fan of Robert C. Martin's work in general, and &lt;a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html"&gt;Clean Architecture&lt;/a&gt; in
particular. I'm frequently on the lookout for how to apply it to the different system
architectures and frameworks we work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which modules should be decoupled? I think the rule is similar to the previous
rule: &lt;em&gt;Any module that changes frequently should be decoupled from the rest of the
system.&lt;/em&gt; — Uncle Bob&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a damn shame that most of the code we are told to write in guides and documentation
(often written by people who are heavily invested in the framework that the docs are
about) are very tightly coupled to the framework, libraries, and persistence implementation
(as well as the REST APIs that are called—how many of us have had to do system-wide
changes because the response object from the API changed?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, in part 1 of a 2 part series, I'll write a bit about what I think is a good way
to implement Clean Architecture in React JS and React Native apps&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantages of switching to Clean Architecture are &lt;a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html"&gt;listed out in detail on Uncle Bob's
blog&lt;/a&gt;, but I am going for three main objectives with regards to having this architecture
on our React app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make the Core 100% testable:&lt;/strong&gt; All external dependencies (the UI, local storage,
   REST APIs etc) can be mocked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Portability:&lt;/strong&gt; If we need to port the app to Vue JS tomorrow, the core can still
   be put there wholesale. We can also explore sharing the core between the frontend and
   backend (if your backend is written in Node or something).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prevent 'Change Propagation':&lt;/strong&gt; If the REST API's response object changes, or we
   change the caching mechanism, or any such change happens upstream of the final consumer
   (the UI), those changes should not cause changes downstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that one of the most important fundamentals of Clean Architecture is to
recognise where your architectural boundaries are, and to ensure that calls across those
boundaries are done using well defined interfaces and contracts. The response object
changing does not change the contract, since the core sets the contract and the code that
calls the API and parses its responses merely implements it. Your DTO is changing? It's
up to the API component to massage that into the existing domain entity, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Standard React async call architecture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Standard React architecture" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/basic-react-arch.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so this a very standard and common pattern when writing the most common kind of
interface, i.e. call an API, display some data in a component. You could be using Redux
for state, or React hooks, or component state, but this diagram barely changes because
in essence the user performs an action, which results in an API call, which updates the
state and hence the UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your component code would look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;const ItemList = ({ items, refreshList }) =&amp;gt; (
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;button onClick={refreshList}&amp;gt;Refresh&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
      {items.map(item =&amp;gt; (
        &amp;lt;li key={item.id}&amp;gt;{item.name}&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
      ))}
    &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
);
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It'll be hooked up to Redux using something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mapStateToProps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kr"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mapDispatchToProps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dispatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;refreshList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dispatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;refreshList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kr"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;connect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;mapStateToProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mapDispatchToProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ItemList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And I'd guess your Thunk (or Saga) would look a bit like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;refreshList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dispatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dispatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;LIST_LOAD_REQUEST&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kr"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;https://your.api/listdata&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kr"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;jsonData&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dispatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;LIST_LOAD_SUCCESS&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;payload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;jsonData&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dispatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;LIST_LOAD_FAILURE&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Pretty simple and familiar, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let's break it&lt;/em&gt; 😈&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Identifying boundaries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I would like to start off by saying it would be unwise to try to break React
and whatever state management solution you use using Clean Architecture. Yes, it's
good to keep them isolated but I'd suggest using React patterns such as presentational
components and containers to do that—this is because Redux and the ilk are tightly
tied to React's Context API, and it would be a massive hassle to handle all that
complexity and coupling in our core. So let's keep it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm thinking of having 3 major components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UI:&lt;/strong&gt; This is in Infrastructure, and is basically React + Redux&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Network and Persistence:&lt;/strong&gt; Also in Infrastructure. I am thinking of hiding the
   API complexity behind a repository interface, and to implement local storage for
   caching if necessary inside this repo implementation itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Application Core:&lt;/strong&gt; This is in the Use Case and Entity layers, and is where the
   magical business logic et al. happens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The component diagram, in my head, looks a bit like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="React with Clean Architecture" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/clean-react-arch-1.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait, where's are we calling the API and getting the data for items? We need to
include an &lt;code&gt;ItemRepository&lt;/code&gt; interface, and an implementation for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="React with Clean Architecture, updated" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/clean-react-arch-2.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the coolest things about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle"&gt;Dependency Inversion&lt;/a&gt;, in that all the
arrows are flowing inwards. In this case, &lt;code&gt;ItemService&lt;/code&gt; depends on the interface
&lt;code&gt;ItemRepository&lt;/code&gt;—which is in the Entity layer—and not on its concrete implementation
which is on a lower layer and will only be injected during runtime. This has several
benefits, &lt;a href="https://janithl.github.io/2019/10/react-clean-architecture-part-2/"&gt;which we'll explore in the next part&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overriding rule that makes this architecture work is The Dependency Rule. This
rule says that source code dependencies can only point inwards. Nothing in an inner
circle can know anything at all about something in an outer circle. In particular,
the name of something declared in an outer circle must not be mentioned by the code
in the an inner circle. That includes, functions, classes. variables, or any other
named software entity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the same token, data formats used in an outer circle should not be used by an inner
circle, especially if those formats are generate by a framework in an outer circle. We
don’t want anything in an outer circle to impact the inner circles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CloudWatch is pretty cool, and looking at a metrics dashboard and setting up
alarms is pretty badass—especially when you're not a full-time DevOps and
don't have the time to worry about your &lt;em&gt;monitoring solution&lt;/em&gt; in addition to
the thing it's &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to look after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're running some of …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Have you tried AWS CLI?" src="https://janithl.github.io/images/aws-cli.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CloudWatch is pretty cool, and looking at a metrics dashboard and setting up
alarms is pretty badass—especially when you're not a full-time DevOps and
don't have the time to worry about your &lt;em&gt;monitoring solution&lt;/em&gt; in addition to
the thing it's &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to look after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're running some of your stuff outside AWS (cue gasps), &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/install-CloudWatch-Agent-on-premise.html"&gt;CloudWatch agent&lt;/a&gt;
is supposed to have you covered, but after following the instructions to a
tee, I found that it wasn't doing what it said on the tin, and the agent was
refusing to start&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhoo, I was running out of time and I absolutely had to get this very simple
metric into CloudWatch, and after 2 days of losing sleep and trying to make
the agent work, I gave up. Thankfully, the ever reliable &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/"&gt;AWS CLI&lt;/a&gt; was
there to pick me up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out a simple &lt;code&gt;aws cloudwatch put-metric-data&lt;/code&gt; is all you need to push
metrics to CloudWatch. There's actually &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html"&gt;an entire doc on it&lt;/a&gt;, which I only
found while writing this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Setup&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to make sure you have a IAM role set up with the ability to push
metrics to CloudWatch, which is &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/create-iam-roles-for-cloudwatch-agent.html"&gt;covered in the CloudWatch agent docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my setup, I just wanted to send the disk utilisation to CloudWatch, so I
created a shell script that looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ch"&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nv"&gt;freeSpace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;df -m &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; awk &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;NR==2{print $4}&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
/usr/local/bin/aws cloudwatch put-metric-data --metric-name my-server-FreeDisk &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
--value &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$freeSpace&lt;/span&gt; --unit Megabytes --namespace my-server --profile AmazonCloudWatchAgent
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here, I am using the &lt;code&gt;--profile&lt;/code&gt; flag to select the correct IAM user, which has
been added to my AWS &lt;code&gt;credentials&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;config&lt;/code&gt; files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shell script was simply called every 5 minutes from a cron job, and I had the
whole setup up and running in no time. You can also do fancy stuff like sending in
entire JSON files, which will surely come in handy if you want to work with Docker
stats etc.&lt;/p&gt;
